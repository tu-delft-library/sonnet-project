Drilling a well is an expensive process in terms of money, time and effort invested. Being an expensive item, wells must be carefully studied before being drilled. In order to make this process more efficient, this dissertation presents a computer-assisted approach of determining the optimal well trajectory using adjoint-based optimization technique. The algorithm is based on surrounding the injection or production wells with dummy wells; a technique proposed in earlier studies. These dummy wells have a minimal rate of injection or production so as to minimalize their influence on the simulated output. The sum of the gradients of the objective function with respect to the flowrate in each dummy well over the life-time of the reservoir is used to define an improved well trajectory. The whole process is repeated until the maximum net present value is achieved. In order to ensure that the newly optimized well trajectory is drillable, the algorithm restricts the curvature of the trajectory. The optimization algorithm was applied to synthetically generated homogeneous and heterogeneous reservoirs to improve a single well trajectory. The algorithm was also successfully tested to improve multiple well trajectories in the \u2018Egg Model\u2019, a three-dimensional heterogeneous channelized reservoir model. In addition to well trajectory optimization, the dissertation also presents an approach to optimize well numbers. This algorithm is based on drilling a dense quasi-well configuration to get an initial knowledge of the reservoir and utilizing this knowledge along with \u2018dummy well\u2019 gradients to reduce the well count. Depending on the reservoir, fluid and economic parameters, both the algorithms display the adeptness to predict optimized type, trajectory and number of wells. Although the optimization results showed a considerable improvement in the net present value of the project, the algorithm can get stuck in local optimum.","Poem":{"Petrarchan sonnet":"\n\nThe cost of drilling a well is great, its placement and trajectory must be straight;\nTo ensure success, it's wise to study first and calculate.\nThis dissertation presents an approach to optimize the route,\nUsing dummy wells that minimize their output rate.\n\nThe gradients of the objective function in each dummy well are used to determine the best path,\nAnd curvature is restricted so that it can be drilled with ease.\nIt was tested on synthetic reservoirs and proved successful in a 3D model known as 'Egg',\nWhere multiple well trajectories were improved with ease. \n\nThe algorithm also optimizes the number of wells required for production or injection, \nBy drilling a dense configuration first to gain knowledge of the reservoir section. \nThough it has been proven adept at predicting type, trajectory and number of wells, \nIt can get stuck in local optimums which no one foretells."},"Jaccard distance":[0.9574468085],"Word intersect":[["wells","trajectory","drilling","trajectories"]]},"1":{"Sonnet title":"Polyphenol","Sonnet text":"More folks, more food.

Moreover, not only the quantity of the demanded food increases but so does the quality. This situation poses an interesting challenge to the food industry that is moving towards the revalorisation of the food waste and, as a part of it, towards the recovery of nutritional compounds that provide health benefits (nutraceuticals) still present in those streams. However, those streams possess very complex chemical and physical characteristics, namely multiple phases, ionic and hydrophobic interactions, etc. Moreover, the concentration of these nutraceuticals tends to be low, making regular processes costly and inefficient if applied to these cases. Therefore, it is extremely important to have models that describe the behaviour of the different components of the system to be able to design and develop a feasible process to recover these molecules. The objective of this research, therefore, was to apply or develop and validate models that could predict important properties for the design of a downstream process in each of the cases. The main focus of the work was on green tea catechins and soy isoflavones. From the beginning, their molecular similarities made clear that Group Contribution (GC) models were the obvious way to reduce complexity. Therefore solubility experiments of the four main catechins (Chapter 2) were performed in order to validate a well know GC activity coefficient model such as Mod. UNIFAC (amongst other models). The validation proved unsuccessful since Mod. UNIFAC did not give good predictions for the interaction between the molecules and water. Activity coefficients are a key property in design since they account for the non-idealities in the system which made the development of a suitable activity coefficient an important part of the research. An extensive bibliographic work was done and solubility values of flavonoids (a class of polyphenols) were gathered in a database that was used for the regression of new interaction parameters for the Mod-UNIFAC model with a new definition of groups more applied to polyphenols. Those parameters were regressed and validated in what is called Modified PolyPhenols-UNIFAC or MPP-UNIFAC (Chapter 3). After having a good understanding of the behaviour of the polyphenols in solution, the next logical step was to model their behaviour in equilibrium with a resin since Solid-Liquid Extraction is one of the most used unit operations. A set of food-grade resins was tested for their suitability to separate catechins from caffeine using green tea as a starting material (Chapter 4). A model-based Design of Experiments was used in order to perform the needed experiments to minimize the uncertainty of the regressed parameters which were further used as criteria for a resin selection. A similar approach was used for the okara. However since okara is a solid matrix, a pretreatment was needed in order to bring the polyphenols to solution. This pretreatment consisted of a solvent extraction with different ratios of ethanol and water. After testing the behaviour of the different extracts with the resin, it was decided to further study the water extract since it maximized the overall yield. Adsorption isotherms were measured (Chapter 5) showing an almost linear behaviour, typical of small concentrations. In some cases it was observed a non-linearity that was hypothesized as a bilayer adsorption of polyphenols onto adsorbed proteins. This hypothesis was then proved for the interaction of medium-hydrophobic isoflavones and highly hydrophobic resins. Moreover, a linear relation was discovered between the logarithm of the slope of the isotherm and the logD value of the compound, pointing into possible predictability of the isotherms for isoflavones. This relationship was further studied for higher concentrations in which the isotherms do not behave linearly. A lattice model was developed to calculate the molar fraction of the compounds in the adsorbed phase in contact with the resin (Chapter 6). This allowed for the experimental calculations of activity coefficients in the adsorbed phase that were modelled with a simple activity coefficient model (Margules). As in previous chapter, a linear relation was discovered between the logarithm of the equilibrium constant and the logD value. Moreover, the regressed interaction parameters showed as well a linear correlation with the logD values of the compounds in equilibrium. This way a \u201ctoolbox\u201d of models is established and validated for the prediction of soy and tea polyphenol properties. These models can be readily used for the design of a separation process or to gain insight and develop an integrated process. Moreover, because of the nature of the models, either group contribution or mechanistic, this toolbox is easily applicable to different polyphenols from different sources.","Poem":{"Petrarchan sonnet":"\n\nThe world's population grows with no pause,\nDemanding food of ever-greater quality;\nThe consequence is waste in every house,\nAnd industry must find a way to see \nThis challenge through and make the best of it:\nTo revalue what was once considered trash,\nAnd find the healthful compounds in the mix,\nThough concentration be low and processes costly. \nIt's vital then to have models that can show \nThe behaviour of the different parts of this;\nTo design a process that can make it flow, \nAnd recover nutraceuticals from this mess. \nThese models are designed and proven true; \nA toolbox for the industry to use."},"Jaccard distance":[0.9746835443],"Word intersect":[["food","waste"]]},"2":{"Sonnet title":"Error","Sonnet text":"Planetaria obey the way\nthat clockworks work.

Currently, the most accurate measurements of solar system dynamics are performed using radiometric tracking systems on planetary missions, providing range measurement with an accuracy in the order of 1 m. Laser ranging to Earth-orbiting satellites equipped with laser retroreflectors provides range data with (sub-)cm accuracy. Extending this technology to planetary missions, however, requires the use of an active space segment equipped with a laser detector and transmitter (for a two-way system). The feasibility of such measurements have been demonstrated at planetary distances, and used operationally (with a one-way system) for the Lunar Reconaissance Orbiter (LRO) mission. The topic of this dissertation is the analysis of the application of interplanetary laser ranging (ILR) to improve the science return from next-generation space missions, with a focus on planetary science objectives. We have simulated laser ranging data for a variety of mission and system architectures, analyzing the influence of both model and measurement uncertainties. Our simulations show that the single-shot measurement precision is relatively inconsequential compared to the systematic range errors, providing a strong rationale for the consistent use of single-photon signal-intensity operation. We find that great advances in planetary geodesy (tidal, rotational characteristics, etc.) could be achieved by ILR. However, the laser data should be accompanied by commensurate improvements in other measurements and data analysis models to maximize the system's science return. The science return from laser ranging data will be especially strong for planetary landers, with a radio system remaining the preferred choice for many orbiter missions. Furthermore, we conclude that the science case for a one-way laser ranging is relatively weak compared to next-generation radiometric tracking systems, requiring the development of much more accurate space-based clocks.","Poem":{"Petrarchan sonnet":"\n\nThe solar system's motion, from natural to artificial,\nProvides us insight into its inner structure and parts.\nRadiometric tracking is most accurate, with one meter precision at its start,\nBut laser ranging gives sub-centimeter accuracy when we aim it at satellites in our chart.\n\nTo use this technology for planetary missions we need an active space segment, \nEquipped with a laser detector and transmitter to make a two-way connection. \nIt has been demonstrated at planetary distances, and used operationally for the LRO mission. \nThis dissertation looks at how ILR can improve science return from next-generation missions. \n\nSimulations of laser ranging data show that single-shot measurement precision is inconsequential compared to systematic range errors; \nSo single-photon signal intensity should be consistently used in order to further explore. \nTidal and rotational characteristics could be improved by ILR; however radio systems remain best for orbiters, and more accurate clocks are needed for one-way laser ranging to succeed. \nThe science return of laser ranging data will be strong for landers indeed!"},"Jaccard distance":[0.972972973],"Word intersect":[["laser","range","errors"]]},"3":{"Sonnet title":"Cancer profiles","Sonnet text":"Innovations at the time of their\ninception tend to blind us with desire\ndrawn to all the things we can acquire\ndissonance dissolves into thin air.\n\nWe thought we caught the cancer DNA\nwith Watson\u2019s project, previous century\nby pairing bases complementary\nconnecting C with G and T with A.\n\nYet while this trick made us plain lyrical\nwe clean forgot its instabilities\nin measuring \u2013 how hypocritical.\n\nOur data shined in small varieties.\nWe tried to make them look statistical\nbut cancer profiling remains Chinese.","Research title":"A critical perspective on microarray breast cancer gene expression profiling","url":"https:\/\/repository.tudelft.nl\/islandora\/object\/uuid%3Aca47f2e0-e6af-4fc7-b4ba-36fb93182b3a","Language":"EN","Abstract":"Microarrays offer biologists an exciting tool that allows the simultaneous assessment of gene expression levels for thousands of genes at once. At the time of their inception, microarrays were hailed as the new dawn in cancer biology and oncology practice with the hope that within a decade diseases like breast cancer would be solved. Various high-profile publications showed the immense potential of this technique in breast cancer event prediction and breast cancer subtyping. From these studies it became clear that breast cancer at the molecular level is not a single disease, but comprises a heterogeneous set of subtypes associated with clear differences in gene expression patterns and clinical outcomes. However, as microarrays became more popular, it became apparent that the accurate analysis and interpretation of microarray data provided a plethora of unique challenges. From a biological, as well as a technical perspective microarray data is complex, while the high feature-to-sample ratio associated with microarray studies rendered many classic statistical procedures useless. To make matters worse, various publications emerged that showed severe stability problems in the model fits of early pilot studies and showed that these studies were often overly optimistic. As a result the reliability of microarray based experiments in general was openly questioned. Given the multitude of different factors which may or may not influence results it is clear that a proper evaluation of microarray breast cancer profiling is both crucial and challenging. This dissertation provides a number of carefully devised protocols, by which the influence of important sources of variation can be isolated, controlled and\/or explicitly quantified, even in the absence of a gold standard. Instead of applying these protocols to data from small spike-in or dilution studies, they were applied to a large collection of real life breast cancer datasets of considerable size. Furthermore, we extensively studied breast cancer subtyping and the evaluation of subtype-specific predictors constructed on these, from both a practical and a theoretical perspective. This work shows that the evaluation of subtype-specific event prediction, based on divide and conquer schemes brings various new statistical challenges. For a variety of frequently encountered performance measures from machine learning several decompositions of the overall performance into subtype-specific performances are provided which show that the relation between subtype-specific and overall performance can be highly complex and counterintuitive. Furthermore, the experiments in this dissertation show that with modern processing techniques and a standardized approach it is possible to construct extremely stable subtyping schemes. However, the selected approach has a strong impact on the obtained results, suggesting that a stringent standardization of the methodologies used for subtyping is not sufficient for the consistent assignment of subtypes to individual patient samples. From these findings we conclude that the molecular subtypes of breast cancer are not sufficiently well understood and need further refinements.","Poem":{"Petrarchan sonnet":"\n\nMicroarrays, a new dawn for cancer research,\nProvide biologists with a tool to assess\nGene expression levels for thousands of genes at once,\nA promise that in just one decade breast cancer would be solved.\n\nHigh-profile publications showed the potential of this technique,\nFor breast cancer event prediction and subtyping it was unique.\nBut as its use became more widespread, its challenges were revealed:\nComplex data and statistical problems had to be unsealed.\n\nStability issues emerged from early pilot studies; \nThe reliability of microarray experiments was questioned by many. \nIt is clear that proper evaluation is both crucial and challenging; \nThis dissertation provides protocols to control variation without a gold standard. \n\nBreast cancer subtyping was studied from practical and theoretical perspectives; \nPerformance measures from machine learning gave complex decompositions. \nModern processing techniques and standardized approaches can construct stable schemes, \nBut the molecular subtypes of breast cancer need further refinements."},"Jaccard distance":[0.9743589744],"Word intersect":[["statistical","data","cancer"]]},"4":{"Sonnet title":"Self-healing","Sonnet text":"Self-healing power is a trick that you\u2019ll\nconnect to Spiderman and Wolverine\nor quinoa or some New Age kind of scene.\nHowever, molecule by molecule\n\nwe optimized some drooly stuff as cool\nno guru, Hulk or Bond has ever seen.\nIt\u2019s called a sol-gel coating and it\u2019s lean\nit\u2019s thermo-sensitive and like a jewel\n\ncombines with almost any metal subsoil.\nMoneywise such film prevents a waste\nof globally per annum eighteen zeroes\n\nmaybe\u2026 What a super-duper foil\nthis hybrid tetra-sulfide polymer-based\nanti-aging cream for rusty heroes.","Research title":"Self-Healing Corrosion Protective Sol-Gel Coatings","url":"https:\/\/repository.tudelft.nl\/islandora\/object\/uuid%3Af5b66298-ed00-4abd-b47c-055c22ae488b","Language":"EN","Abstract":"Inspired by the state of the art and the recent advances in the field of self-healing corrosion protective coatings, the thesis entitled \u201cSelf-healing corrosion protective sol-gel coatings\u201d addresses novel routes to self-healing corrosion protective sol-gel coatings via extrinsic and intrinsic healing approaches.

The goal is to combine good physical insight, appropriate numerical methods and good software development in the context of the general framework of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). For model validation to be possible, availability of relevant, accurate and complete experimental datasets is important. For this study the database of Delft Spray-in-Hot-Coflow(DSHC) flames has been employed. Using different combinations of model components and approaches, the modeling has been developed and tested at three levels of complexity and accuracy. Depending on the chosen combination of turbulence and combustion models, the modeling methods used in this thesis are the following: 1) Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach for turbulence modeling with Steady Flamelet Model (SFM) approach for combustion; 2) Transported Probability Density Function (TPDF) approach for turbulence modeling with Flamelet Generated Manifolds (FGM) for combustion; 3) Largy Eddy Simulation (LES) for turbulence with FGM for combustion. The CFD codes that are used for these methods are respectively the commercial software ANSYS Fluent (version 15.0), the in-house code \u201cPDFD\u201d and the open source software OpenFOAM. The first stage of the research aimed at exploring the characteristics of the target flames, and gaining understanding of the relevance of each model component in order to clarify the directions of further model improvements. Existing standard models (RANS\/SFM) within the commercial software were employed for this purpose. The main outcome of this stage of the study is that the SFM fails in predicting the lifted-off phenomena of the DSHC flames, and it is concluded that a more sophisticated Turbulence-Chemistry Interaction (TCI) model is required. In the second stage of the study, advancements on both turbulence and combustion models have been made, respectively with TPDF and FGM. TPDF was used because it offers a more detailed description of statistical properties and FGM because it offers the possibility to include finite rate chemical effects in the frame of TPDF at affordable cost. In this stage of the study the focus was on simulations of the dilute spray region. Ignoring the dense region close to the atomizer, the simulation starts from a certain distance downstream, preferably a region where experimental data are available or good insight in local conditions is available by other means. Because of the careful specification of the boundary conditions of spray as well as gas phase, the flow and combustion development downstream were correctly reproduced by this approach, including the lift-off height. Next, based on this platform, parametric studies on many important aspects have been carried out, for example, the influence of the droplet initial temperature, a comparison between different model variants on evaporation etc. Good agreement with experimental data was achieved and useful information on model performance was obtained. However, also limitations of the modeling approach were identified. The most important one is that the use of an adiabatic approach disregarding the energy consumed in the evaporation of liquid (adiabatic FGM table) over-predicts the gas phase temperature in the region of intense droplets evaporation. In the third stage of this study we used Large Eddy Simulation of turbulence in combination with non-adiabatic FGM for evaporation and combustion. The subgrid scale fluctuations of the FGM scalars were modeled using assumed-shape PDFs. The CFD platform for doing so is the open source CFD package \u2014 OpenFOAM. Since the desired FGM model is not available in the public released version of OpenFOAM, the first step in this third stage was development and validation of a new implementation of FGM. A well-documented gaseous lifted flame in hot-diluted coflow was used as test case. In this study, it was found that the auto-ignition process is highly sensitive to the model constants that are used to evaluate the variances of mixture fraction and progress variable. Dynamic procedures have been developed for the determination of these constants in the context of LES. Using the developed dynamic models significant improvement of the prediction of the flame lift-off height has been achieved. The second step of LES\/FGM method development was the extension of the implemented FGM method to spray combustion. Two major model developments were completed in this step \u2014 the Condition Droplet Injection Model (CDIM) and the non-adiabatic FGM method. The CDIM was proposed to take into account the influence of flash-boiling atomization of the DSHC flames. The comparison of CIDM with a conventional droplet injection model showed superior performance of the CDIM in modeling of the DSHC flames. Furthermore, with the addition of enthalpy deficit as an extra dimension of the FGM table, the prediction of the gas phase temperature was significantly improved. The third step of modeling stage three was to apply the developed LES\/FGM method to a wide range of test cases including the hot and cold coflow cases to test the range of applicability of models, and to some virtual (i.e. not yet studied experimentally) cases in order to gain deeper insight on the involved phenomena. The simulations showed that the developed LES\/FGM method is able to correctly capture major features of spray flames under different coflow conditions, for example the flame width and flame lift-off height. Independent parameter study of the coflow temperature and oxygen concentration clarified the effects of these two important factors, and suggested better operation conditions to achieve a strict MILD spray combustion condition. Simulation and comparison of the hot coflow (Hii) and cold coflow (Aii) cases revealed very interesting mechanisms that determine different flame structures and their transition in spray combustion. The \u201csingle\u201d and \u201cdouble\u201d flame structures of these two cases have been successfully reproduced. Detailed analysis showed that the actual flame topologies have been over-simplified by their conventional names (single\/double flame) used in literature, which are mainly based on the experimental observation. It was found that the appearance of multi-flame or multiple reaction regions in spray combustion are resulting from the disparity of time scales of the processes involved. And it was further demonstrated that by matching important time scales, similar flame structure can be achieved under considerably different operating conditions. In summary, three different levels of modeling approaches for spray combustion have been developed and tested. These approaches can be employed in different applications based on the consideration of the required accuracy and computational affordability. The RANS\/SFM is the cheapest one in terms of computation cost, but the interpretation of the results should take into account that a number of important aspects such as lift-off height are not well predicted. The LES\/FGM method provides most accurate results compared to other two, but is also most computationally demanding. The method using the last approach offers the most promises for a better understanding of the MILD spray combustion and design of clean and efficient combustion technology.","Poem":{"Petrarchan sonnet":"\n\nThe goal of this research so grand,\nTo model liquid fuel combustion's brand,\nCombining insight, numerical methods and software too,\nIn the framework of CFD for all to view.\nExperimental data must be found,\nFor validation on solid ground,\nThe DSHC flames were employed in this case,\nTo study the spray region with great grace. \nRANS\/SFM was used at first stage, \nBut failed to predict lift-off rage. \nTPDF and FGM models did improve \nAnd boundary conditions were made to move. \nParametric studies then revealed much more \nOn evaporation than ever before. \nAdiabatic FGM over-predicted gas phase temperature though, \nLimiting its use in this show. \nLES\/FGM was then used with non-adiabatic FGM too, \nAnd OpenFOAM was the software that they knew. \nCDIM was proposed to take into account flash boiling atomization too, \nAnd enthalpy deficit improved prediction of flame lift-off true.  \n\nFinally LES\/FGM was applied to a wide range of test cases here and there,  \nCapturing major features of spray flames with much care.  \nParameter study of coflow temperature and oxygen concentration showed us how,  \nFor better operation conditions that are strict MILD now.  \n\nThis research has shown us the way to go,  \nIn understanding MILD spray combustion flow.  \n\nSo let us use these approaches wisely and well;  \nOur knowledge will help our future tell!"},"Jaccard distance":[0.9701492537],"Word intersect":[["combustion","models","spray","fuel"]]},"6":{"Sonnet title":"Glycolysis","Sonnet text":"Don\u2019t underestimate the might of yeast\nwith its fermenting glycolytic genes\nproducing families of proteins\nquite as complex as those of man at least.\n\nThe story goes, some 100 million years\nago, this organism duplicated\nits genome.

Glycolysis is not only a catabolic route involved in energy conservation, but also provides building blocks for anabolism. From an applied perspective, several glycolytic intermediates are key precursors for the production of a wide range of highly valuable compounds. The most obvious case is the production of ethanol from pyruvate. Its ability to rapidly ferment sugars to ethanol has made S. cerevisiae the major microbial player in large scale biofuel production. Because of its importance in cellular processes and in the biotechnology industry, glycolysis in S. cerevisiae has been studied in detail. However, despite the large amount of information generated about all the components in glycolysis, the limited understanding on how these components interact and are co-ordinately regulated to ensure a robust and balanced pathway, has to date defied all metabolic engineering attempts to significantly accelerate glycolytic flux. So far, the mechanisms that govern the glycolytic flux are not fully known. A particularly poorly understood factor in glycolysis is its high genetic redundancy. This phenomenon is observed in many organisms, but is highly pronounced in S. cerevisiae which, for most glycolytic reactions, harbours multiple isoenzymes and corresponding paralogous genes. The contribution of the glycolytic paralogs to the glycolytic flux is unknown and the simultaneous presence of different isoenzymes \u2013 with potentially different kinetic and regulatory properties - complicates the mathematical modelling that is required for a deeper understanding of the regulation of this industrially relevant pathway. Saccharomyces cerevisiae\u2019s glycolytic pathway consist of ten biochemical reactions. In this Crabtree positive yeast, glycolysis is under most growth conditions linked to ethanol formation. Without considering the very complex transport of glucose from the extracellular environment to the intracellular compartment, glycolysis and ethanol fermentation together encompass 12 biochemical reactions. These biochemical reactions are catalysed by enzymes encoded in 27 glycolytic genes, separated in eight paralog families and four unique structural genes. S. cerevisiae evolved from an ancestor that, approximately 100 million years ago, underwent a whole genome duplication (WGD). Many of its hallmark phenotypic characteristics have been proposed to be the result of this duplication event and the subsequent genome rearrangement, gene loss and gains through evolution. In S. cerevisiae, no fewer than eight of the ten enzyme reactions in glycolysis are represented by multiple paralogs genes. This incidence of paralogous combinations represents a significant overrepresentation relative to the ca. 26 % of the yeast genome that consists of paralogous combinations. The WGD event and resulting duplication of glycolytic genes has been proposed to have contributed to the strong tendency of this yeast to produce ethanol under aerobic conditions (Crabtree effect) and to its high glycolytic capacity. However, the impact of reducing the number of glycolytic paralogs on these and other physiological characteristics of S. cerevisiae has not been systematically explored. All glycolytic reactions are equally essential for yeast growth on glucose. However, for all paralogs gene sets in yeast glycolysis, with the notable exception of phosphofructokinase, gene expression and gene deletion studies support the definition of a single, major paralog and one to four minor paralogs. Additionally, except for the pseudogenes GPM2 and GPM3, all paralogs have retained their original catalytic function, although their context-dependent expression profiles differ. Furthermore, deletion of minor paralogs for individual glycolytic enzymes has minor effects on enzyme activities in cell extracts and on specific growth rate under standard laboratory conditions. Reduction of the genetic complexity in S. cerevisiae\u2019s glycolysis could deliver a more predictable and malleable glycolytic pathway. These characteristics could greatly benefit the biotechnology industry and our understanding about glycolysis. Thus, the main goal of this thesis was the construction and analysis of a strain with a minimal set of glycolytic enzymes. Despite the astonishing genetic accessibility of S. cerevisiae and its broad genetic toolbox, large-scale deletion strategies, like the deletion of 13 genes undertaken in the present thesis, were a challenging endeavour at the outset of this project, that only few previous studies had tackled. Despite the large collection of selectable marker genes for genetic modification available for S. cerevisiae, marker availability still presented a hurdle when dozens of genetic deletions were required. Additionally, the presence of the selectable markers in the host genome can influence the fitness or performance of the strain, thus, different methods for marker removal were required. Deletion of the hexose transporter genes (HXT\u2019s) in S. cerevisiae has, for over a decade, represented the paradigm for elimination of complexity in a large, redundant paralog family. This yeast harbours a large group of tightly controlled transporters with different characteristics for glucose uptake. This family is composed of genes with similar function but that are expressed under different conditions, thereby allowing yeast to grow and cope with large and dynamic changes in glucose concentration. Interestingly, deletion of single or several HXT\u2019s does not abolish growth on glucose. In 1999, Eckhard Boles and his team took on the enormous endeavour of removing all transporters capable to import glucose in S. cerevisiae, resulting in the strain EBY.VW4000. Ever since its construction, EBY.VW4000 has become a widely used platform for the discovery and characterization of transporters from a wide range of organisms and as a platform strain for metabolic engineering approaches. Additionally, EBY.VW4000, with its reduced genetic redundancy in glucose transport, could serve as an splendid platform for the construction of a minimal glycolytic pathway. Despite the extensive usage of this strain, the genome of EBY.VW4000 had hitherto not been characterized in detail. Chapter 2 addresses this information gap and presents the whole-genome sequence of EBY.VW4000. To abolish glucose uptake in this strain, 21 genes (including all HXT\u2019s) had been knocked-out across 16 successive deletion rounds with the LoxP\/Cre system. Based on a combination of whole-genome sequencing, karyotyping and molecular confirmation, we demonstrated that the construction of EBY.VW4000 resulted in gene losses and chromosomal rearrangements guided by LoxP\/Cre. In contrast, only 13 single nucleotide variations (SNV\u2019s) were identified. Recombinations between LoxP scars led to the assembly of four neo-chromosomes, truncation of two chromosomes and the loss of two telomeric regions. By karyotyping the EBY.VW4000 lineage, it became clear that its current chromosomal architecture has resulted from four translocations events that occurred between the 6th and the 12th rounds of deletion\/marker recycling. Additionally, sporulation and spore germination were found to be severely impaired in EBY.VW4000. This work also demonstrated that, due to the massive LoxP\/Cre-induced genome modifications observed, neither EBY.VW4000 nor LoxP\/Cre were suitable for the construction of a minimal glycolysis strain. Therefore, a combination of classical genetic deletion and novel tools and methodologies were developed and implemented. In Chapter 3 the new recyclable dominant marker cassette amdSYM, formed by the Ashbya gossypii TEF2 promoter and terminator and a codon-optimized acetamidase gene (Aspergillus nidulans amdS) is presented. This module confers laboratory, wild and industrial Saccharomyces strains the ability to use acetamide as sole nitrogen source. Direct repeats flanking the marker cassette allow for its efficient recombinative excision. This cassette loss can be rapidly selected for by growth in the presence of fluoroacetamide. The amdSYM cassette can be used in different genetic backgrounds and represents the first counterselectable dominant marker gene cassette for use in Saccharomyces strains. Furthermore, using astute cassette design, amdSYM excision could be performed without leaving a scar or heterologous sequences in the targeted genome. The amdSYM cassette is available for the scientific community via the Euroscarf collection. Including the amdSYM marker cassette, only four counter-selectable markers for S. cerevisiae are available. Extensive strain engineering is severely hampered by this limited marker availability and by the reduced genome stability that occurs upon repeated use of heterologous recombinase-based marker removal methods such as LoxP\/Cre system. Chapter 4 introduces an efficient method to recycle multiple markers in S. cerevisiae simultaneously, thereby circumventing shortcomings of existing techniques and substantially accelerating the process of selection-excision. This method relies on artificial generation of double strand breaks around the selection marker cassette by the meganuclease I-SceI and the subsequent repair of these breaks by the yeast homologous recombination machinery, guided by direct repeats. Simultaneous removal of up to three marker cassettes was achieved with high efficiencies (up to 56%). This locus- and marker-independent method can be used for both dominant and auxotrophy-complementing marker genes. Chapter 5 describes the experimental exploration of genetic redundancy in yeast glycolysis by cumulative deletion of minor paralogs and presents a new experimental platform for fundamental yeast research by constructing a yeast strain with a functional minimal glycolysis. The construction of this strain was performed with a combination of classical genetics tools and the newly developed methodologies presented in this thesis. It encompassed the deletion of 13 glycolytic paralogs considered to have a minor contribution to flux. After thorough experimental analysis, using quantitative and systems approaches, under growth conditions leading to a high glycolytic flux and after semi-quantitative analysis under a wide range of growth conditions, the most remarkable feature of the minimal glycolysis strain was the lack of visible phenotypic response to the deletion of 13 genes. The high glycolytic rates in anaerobic cultures of the minimal glycolysis strain and the small effect on the transcriptome argue against gene dosage or back-up effects as means for fixing minor glycolytic paralogs in the yeast genome. The near-wild type growth kinetics of the minimal glycolysis strain in aerobic and anaerobic cultures are difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that duplication of glycolytic genes during the WGD event played a major role in increasing its glycolytic capacity or in causing the Crabtree effect. This reduction of genetic complexity contributed to the understanding of yeast glycolysis by, for the first time, studying the synergetic effects of multiple deletions of glycolytic genes. Moreover, it eliminated intrinsic uncertainties caused by the simultaneous, context-dependent expression of different isoenzymes, facilitating the formulation and validation of mathematical models that describe the kinetics of this key metabolic pathway. Analysis of the physiology and fitness of the minimal glycolysis strain under dynamic man-made and natural conditions may contribute to the daunting but exciting task of resolving the origin, fate, evolution and role of glycolytic paralogs. Additionally, it will serve as a basis for a more extreme genetic and pathway engineering strategy, in which different glycolytic pathways can be redesigned and interchanged in two simple steps.","Poem":{"Petrarchan sonnet":"\n\nThough Saccharomyces cerevisiae's glycolysis is complex,\nIts biochemical reactions form the core of sugar metabolism.\nIt provides building blocks for anabolism and energy conservation,\nAnd its ability to ferment sugars to ethanol has made it a major player in biofuel production.\n\nDespite the large amount of information generated about its components,\nThe mechanisms that govern its flux remain unknown.\nThis Crabtree positive yeast has eight paralogs for most glycolytic reactions, \nWhich have been proposed to contribute to its high glycolytic capacity. \n\nA strain with a minimal set of glycolytic enzymes was constructed and analyzed; \n21 genes were knocked out across 16 successive deletion rounds. \nFour neo-chromosomes were assembled and two telomeric regions were lost; \nRecombinations between LoxP scars led to chromosomal rearrangements. \n\nUsing classical genetics tools and novel methodologies, this minimal strain was created; \nSimultaneous removal of up to three marker cassettes was achieved with high efficiencies. \nIt showed no visible phenotypic response after the deletion of thirteen genes, \nContradicting hypotheses that duplication of glycolytic genes caused the Crabtree effect."},"Jaccard distance":[0.9421487603],"Word intersect":[["flux","yeast","glycolytic","effect","complex","genes","despite"]]},"7":{"Sonnet title":"DIY quantum physics","Sonnet text":"Electrons can be fixed by anarchy\nin nanowire as thermometer\nfor an astronomer to monitor \neach photon flying through the galaxy.\n\nThis is a quantum thing \u2013 so much is true\ncreating super sensitivity\nby means of endless resistivity\nbut how it really worked, we had no clue.\n\nTherefore we started our experiment\nwith quasiparticles in excitation\nmodelling some \u03b1 element\n\nto find the right phase fluctuation\nin a zero K environment.\nComing soon as homemade application\u2026","Research title":"Electrodynamics of strongly disordered superconductors","url":"https:\/\/repository.tudelft.nl\/islandora\/object\/uuid%3Aad01901d-511f-4496-ae66-301d0db92caa","Language":"EN","Abstract":"Thin films of superconducting materials with a high resistance in the normal state, such as TiN, NbTiN, NbN and InO, are intensively studied from both an application and a fundamental point of view.

Current space-born radiometers can provide daily observations to derive surface radiative fluxes at a spatial resolution of one square kilometer at best, which is not enough to properly take into account surface heterogeneity in many regions of the globe. As part of a major scientific initiative to study the hydrology of the Tibetan Plateau -especially known for its rough topography- this thesis focuses on developing a method to adequately estimate at-surface daily solar radiation budget over this particular area. Following a first effort to produce a time series of the radiative budget from existing satellite data products, it appeared that it is necessary to consider terrain and clouds spatial variability at the sub-pixel level when working over heterogeneous areas such as the Tibetan Plateau. Thus, the impact of spatial and temporal variability of clouds on solar radiation was investigated through a case study conducted on the field whose results demonstrate that the surface irradiance estimation would benefit from using cloud distribution instead of cloud fraction to account for the cloud cover. Furthermore, a high temporal resolution cloud cover leads to a better temporal average of the radiative fluxes. Regarding the effects of the terrain, a new sub-pixel topographic correction method is proposed and applied. It demonstrates that the integration of the sub-pixel topographic effects using high resolution DEM improves the irradiance as well as the albedo retrieval. The temporal resolution of the latter is also to consider and the use of geostationary satellite allows to increase the retrieval frequency. Based on multi-source and multi-resolution remote sensing data, the developed method provides a usable solar radiation budget dataset. Combined with the outcomes of the in-depth researches on clouds and topography, it paves the way for a new operational methodology which adequately accounts for sub-pixel heterogeneity when producing large area time series of solar radiation budget at the surface.","Poem":{"Petrarchan sonnet":"\n\nThough we strive to understand the land's surface,\nThe solar radiation budget we must monitor;\nTo study hydrology and climatology,\nWe need daily observations that explore.\n\nBut current space-born radiometers lack,\nThe spatial resolution of one square kilometer;\nFor regions like Tibet with its rugged terrain,\nA new method must be found to make it clearer.\n\nA case study on clouds was done in the field, \nIt showed that cloud distribution is key; \nFor better temporal average of fluxes seen, \nHigh temporal resolution cloud cover should be. \n \nSub-pixel topographic correction was proposed, \nTo integrate high resolution DEMs with ease; \nMulti-source data used for usable dataset, \nFor operational methodology to appease."},"Jaccard distance":[0.9569892473],"Word intersect":[["terrain","radiation","high","clouds"]]},"10":{"Sonnet title":"Cybersecurity","Sonnet text":"Internet security is quite\na nut to crack.

The arm support needs to be inconspicuous and not stigmatizing, to encourage the users to participate in social activities. Ideally, the device fits underneath clothing. The first sub-goal is to review the state-of-the-art in dynamic arm supports in detail. At the date of publication of the review (June 2013), 23 dynamic passive and active arm supports were found, from which only 4 were wearable. Most of the devices that were found use a parallelogram linkage structure. This structure limits the range of motion of the arm and has a large volume. None of the devices were inconspicuous and fitted underneath clothing. The detailed review to these devices concludes that a serial linkage from the trunk to the arm is required to make the device inconspicuous and underneath clothing. This linkage should have the same degrees of freedom (DoF) as the human arm (3 DoF at the shoulder, 1 DoF at the elbow). In addition, the use of a passive support implies smaller actuators in case an active support is needed. The knowledge from the review is taken into account when defining concepts for a close-to-body arm support (second sub-goal). The focus of the concept elaboration was on compliant structures and on a linkage system with rubber springs. The compliant structure concept was elaborated with two designs. One design uses bending beams as spring elements to support the upper arm. With only two very slender bending beams the upper arm was balanced in a single plane. A proof-of-principle prototype showed that the device gives enough support, is very slender (4 times smaller than current arm supports), and is comfortable. A second design and proof-of-principle prototype showed support of the forearm with a compliant joint consisting of 4 bi-stable leaf springs. The compliant elbow joint has self-aligning capabilities and can be worn underneath clothing. Nevertheless, the forearm is only supported, against gravity, in a single plane. Next to the compliant structure concept, a linkage system with rubber springs is elaborated as a concept for a close-to-body arm support. The focus is on slender and close-to-body spring configurations. Analysis and re-definition of the theory of designing spring configurations resulted in the ability to create designs with multiple serial links. The main accomplishment of re-defining the theory is that the locations of the attachment points of the springs could be calculated very intuitive. Next to that, the behavior of the spring configuration for varying the parameters in the configuration (locations of the attachment points or the spring stiffness) becomes more understandable. In the process, different spring configurations were designed. One spring configuration uses 2 bi-articular springs from the trunk to the forearm, parallel to the upper arm. Some locations of the attachment points of the springs can be chosen freely, others are related to these chosen locations. Another design balances the complete arm with 3 springs. In this configuration, each location of the spring attachment can be chosen freely and close to the body. The required balancing quality can be obtained by adjusting the spring stiffnesses. The balancing quality can be adjusted very easily to the preference of the user during the day. A comparison of the balancing quality and tuning capabilities of different spring configurations showed that the 3-springs configuration is excellent to apply in a close-to-body arm support. This is mainly due to its easiness of achieving and tuning the required balancing quality, and due to the opportunity to locate the spring attachments close to the body. The third sub-goal was to apply the developed spring configurations into prototypes that could be evaluated on patients with DMD. The first prototype was based on a parallelogram structure, parallel to the body, running from the upper legs and hip to the forearm of the user. This prototype shows the advantage of trunk motion capability. The range of motion of the user increases by 10%, compared to the use of a currently available arm support that is attached to the wheelchair. For reaching anteriorly the increase in range of motion is even 50%. The surface electromyography (sEMG) activity is similar. This trunk motion capability was considered as very important by the patients. Therefore, it was included in all the future prototypes as well. Nevertheless, the prototype also showed that the parallelogram structure next to the arm limited the range of motion of the arm. This is because the DoF of the prototype were not similar as the DoF of the human arm. For this reason, in the second prototype this structure was redesigned such that it follows the body contours of the user. This resulted in a kinematic structure with 3 DoF at the shoulder joint and 1 DoF at the elbow joint. The structure was combined with a 2-springs configuration (based on an existing theoretical model). Rubber bands were used as spring elements. The prototype was evaluated with DMD patients and shows good results on comfort, balancing quality (less than 6% error with respect to the required balancing force) and range of motion. The user is able to perform most of the important activities of daily living again (e.q., eating, drinking, table-top activities, reaching the face, scratch the head, reaching for high objects). A downside of this device was that the spring configuration is not inconspicuous. Due to limitations of the spring configuration it is not possible to position the device closer to the body. Therefore, the third prototype is developed with the focus to position the spring configuration closer to the body. The 3-springs configuration was applied in the prototype. The rubber springs were split into hollow spring structures that fit around the body. In combination with covers on specific places to provide safety, extra structures for sideways stabilization and anatomically shaped body interfaces for more comfort, the third version of the prototype fits within 30mm from the body. This design allows for further optimization to bring the device even closer to the body. With this result, a wearable passive dynamic arm support is developed that supports the user during activities of daily living and is not stigmatizing.","Poem":{"Petrarchan sonnet":"\n\nEen doel, een droom, om armen sterk te maken:\nEen draagbaar apparaat dat DMD-pati\u00ebnten helpt.\nGeen stigmatisering, maar onzichtbaar en discreet;\nHet moet onder kleding passen, dus zo subtiel als het welt. \n\nAllereerst werd de stand van zaken bestudeerd:\nVan dynamische armsteunen vond men er veertien.\nDe meeste gebruikten een parallellogramstructuur;\nDit beperkte de bewegingsvrijheid en was ook nog groot. \n\nDaarom werd gezocht naar andere mogelijkheden: \nCompliante structuren en scharnieren met rubberen veren. \nTwee ontwerpen die de bovenarm steunden met twee dunne buigbare balken; \nEn eentje die de onderarm had met vier bi-stabiele bladveren. \n\nVervolgens werd gekeken naar scharnierconfiguraties: \nTheorie over het ontwerpen van veersystemen werd herdefini\u00ebrd. \nMet behulp van dit model kon men scharnieren maken die heel dicht bij het lichaam pasten; \nTwee bi-articulaire veren die parallel aan de bovenarm lopen of drie veren die de hele arm steunend vasthouden.  \n\nPrototypes werden gemaakt en getest op pati\u00ebnten met DMD; \nE\u00e9n met een parallellogramstructuur waarbij het bereik van beweging toeneemde, \u00e9n eentje met twee veren waarbij comfort en stabiliteit verbeterden.  \n\nUiteindelijk is er nu eentje dat alsmaar dichter bij het lichaam past: \nMet holle rubberen veren, covers voor extra veiligheid en anatomisch"},"Jaccard distance":[0.9770992366],"Word intersect":[["armen","beweging","scharnieren"]]},"13":{"Sonnet title":"Life cycle clothing","Sonnet text":"Fashion and sustainability\nare worlds apart.

Embracing uncertainty and subjectivity allows for relatively simple tools, as the tools do not need to be more accurate than our knowledge of the future. The condition for this to work is that the rational RBO decisions are embedded in a well-designed sociotechnical process.

Multi-models reflect this complexity and are useful to analyse these complex socio-technical systems. They consist of connected simulation models which may each have their focus on a subsystem or modelling paradigm. However, these models contain different types of uncertainties influencing the fidelity of the results. Several methods are available to identify and analyse these uncertainties. It is yet unknown if and how existing uncertainty analysis methods can be applied to multi-model ecologies. In this thesis, we aim to provide for an answer to the following research question: \u201cTo what extent can we apply existing uncertainty analysis methods to multi-models?\u201d To answer this question, it is important to first identify additional uncertainties in multi-model ecologies compared to single models. Next, we identify and apply methods to analyse these additional uncertainties. As proof of principle, a multi-model is used which focusses on the expansion and decarbonisation of the energy grid in the Port of Rotterdam. There are three dimensions of uncertainty in simulation models: location, level, and nature. The different locations include the conceptual model, the computer model, input data, the technical model implementation, and the processed output data. In multi-models, we found an additional location: the interface. This is where the exchange of parameters between the models takes place. Within the multi-model locations, we identified some aspects that increase uncertainty. Epistemic opacity and computational expense are properties of multi-models that limit the analyst's knowledge of the multi-model and the feasibility of extensive uncertainty analyses. The methods we identified for analysing these types of uncertainties are divided into sensitivity analysis and calibration. Sensitivity analysis quantifies the contribution of specific uncertainties to the overall uncertainty in the model outcome. Well-established methods are extra-trees feature scoring and Sobol. Calibration methods are based on the notion of equifinality. Using a specified likelihood function, they determine parameter values that lead to results with a high likelihood. Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods are often used for calibration purposes. The applicability of these methods depends on the multi-model configuration. To describe these configurations, two limiting archetypes were used: directed graphs, and undirected graphs with feedback mechanisms over the model components. We found that uncertainty analysis of direct graphs can be carried out on both the model components and the whole. For undirected graphs, the research showed only added value in performing an uncertainty analysis on the whole multi-model. Otherwise, the changing context and emerging path dependencies cannot be included. The application of extra-trees feature scoring, Sobol, and MCMC on the case study model showed that methods for uncertainty analysis are applicable on multi-models by including uncertainties on the interface. Furthermore, it is possible to reduce computational costs by factor fixing, distinguishing between deep and stochastic uncertainties, and assessing the convergence of sensitivity indices. Epistemic opacity can be dealt with by performing multiple replications and by including uncertainties related to the technical implementation of the multi-model. MCMC methods are suitable for scenario discovery, which provides insight into parameter values that lead to specific model results. For future research on this topic, it is recommended to apply uncertainty analysis on multi-models with different network structures and a higher number of model components. This research offers a single case study multi-model, being an undirected graph with two model components. The role of uncertainties on the interface, epistemic opacity, and computational expense should then be further investigated in these different configurations. In addition, other uncertainty analysis methods in the context of multi-modelling could be investigated. Especially the application of moment-independent sensitivity analyses could be interesting to investigate further, since multimodal outcomes can arise from the interaction of heterogeneous models.","Poem":{"Petrarchan sonnet":"\n\nOur contemporary society\u2019s complexity,\nA web of social and technical parts,\nRequires multi-models to explain its effects,\nWhich come with uncertainties in many sorts.\nThese models, with focus on a single part,\nAre connected by an interface unknown;\nUncertainties here are hard to chart,\nAnd so we seek to answer this unknown. \nWe must identify the sources of doubt,\nThat hinder our analysis of these models;\nEpistemic opacity and cost amount \nTo challenges that must be met with shovels. \nSo let us use existing methods true, \nTo answer questions posed to me and you."},"Jaccard distance":[0.9864864865],"Word intersect":[["models"]]},"19":{"Sonnet title":"Missing the buzz\u2026 ","Sonnet text":"The thing with public transport is, performance \nrises from a crowd of interacting \nagents buzzing, networking, connecting \nchaos, also known as governance. \n\nTo study this is quite a tricky dance \na wicked mix of opposites attracting \nand those being affected are affecting \njust like there\u2019s no thing as one-way romance. \n\nAre you an agent that does not know better \nthan to talk, to yak, to squabble and discuss \neternally?

Due to the high speed of match play nunchaku-do, its referees experience problems when observing scores, and determining who struck first, especially in the case of near-simultaneous scoring attempts. Evidently, referees have insufficient tools at their disposal to let transparent sports justice be done. There is therefore significant potential for the deployment of smart materials and sensor technology as decision aids to bridge this gap. A series of experiments and tinkering exercises was staged, to refine a list of eligible sensor technologies, and what they need in order to perform reliably. These activities revealed that tactile sensors and inertial sensors offered the most promise for detecting the impacts from a player\u2019s attempted score. This inspired the formation of three potential design directions that made use of these technologies. One of these directions was developed further, leading to a sophisticated suggestion for a custom pressure sensor matrix which is integrated in a traditional safety nunchaku\u2019s handles, effectively turning it into a smart nunchaku. This embedded sensor, boasting an array of pressure-sensitive points instead of only one large area, detects differences in the types of contact it makes, enabling it to recognise strikes, (re)grips, and blocks, for the referee\u2019s benefit. A small microcontroller, paired with a wireless transmitter, relays these conclusions to a master device, which relays the information to referees, who are then able to better make their calls. This intermediary feedback could be seen as an additional sense for the referee, rather than a device that attempts to claim or override the referee\u2019s ontological authority. A series of iterative prototypes for the proposed design\u2019s sensor were developed to test the sensor's performance. A first proof of concept was developed on a smaller scale, and confirmed that the pressure sensor could provide reliable and consistent output values. A second, full-scale version of the pressure sensor matrix was successfully embedded in a safety nunchaku, keeping the original materials intact as much as possible. A battery-powered microcontroller with the capacity to wirelessly broadcast sensor data over Bluetooth was mounted to the experimental nunchaku, to record, process, and transmit recorded sensor data. To assess how well the proposed sensor can distinguish strikes, regrips, blocks, and failed regrips, these actions were all performed and recorded in a test setup, using the constructed full-scale prototype. A high speed camera was used to record video in tandem with the sensor, so that the values obtained could be carefully compared to the camera\u2019s frame data. The sensor\u2019s ability to separate (re)grips from strikes (score attempts), which is by far the most essential feature needed for the sensor to perform as a decision aid, was confirmed through the experiment, though the pattern behind grips turned out to be different than had been predicted earlier. Estimation of a strike\u2019s contact surface area and force proved feasible, perhaps even to the extent of being able to reliably detect blocked strikes. Failed regrips, where a practitioner attempts a regrip but fails to clutch the nunchaku\u2019s handle, could not be distinguished from strikes. These observations resulted in an updated and experimentally verified pressure event distinction heuristic. A series of calibrations and vector calculations were performed on raw sensor data, in order to judge the pressure sensor matrix\u2019 ability to determine a resultant force over time. This resultant over time would be considered indicative of the force a fighter has put behind an individual scoring attempt. Though the sensor appears to have the required operational range and resolution to establish this metric, further tests are needed to verify its applicability in terms of establishing an accepted force range for players\u2019 strikes. The technology behind the sensor could also prove useful for many other situations where specific types of pressure are to be identified, especially considering the affordable, maker-friendly properties of the materials used.","Poem":{"Petrarchan sonnet":"\n\nThe nunchaku, a weapon so exotic and grand,\nWas popularised by Bruce Lee in his films.\nIt was adopted by Dutch enthusiasts who planned\nTo create a dynamic martial art that thrills.\nReferees had trouble to score when two attacks\nWere near-simultaneous, with no tool to aid.\nSmart materials and sensors could fill the gaps;\nDecision aids that referees could have made.\nA pressure sensor matrix in handles of wood,\nTurned the traditional nunchaku into smarts;\nDetecting strikes, (re)grips and blocks for the good;\nIntermediary feedback to give its parts. \nPrototypes were made to test the sensor\u2019s performance; \nForced range is needed yet for referee's acceptance."},"Jaccard distance":[0.9651162791],"Word intersect":[["nunchaku","referees","smart"]]},"22":{"Sonnet title":"Beefschild","Sonnet text":"Heel diep onder Grunnse klei en zand\ndaar haalden we wel z\u00f3veel gas vandaan\ndat aarde er van beven is gegaan\nEn nu is er iets lastigs aan de hand:\n\nKijk, vroeger bleef zo'n stenen huis wel staan\nin weer en wind, daar bij het Hooge Land,\nmaar baksteen is er niet tegen bestand\nals Richters naald dramatisch uit gaat slaan.\n\nGelukkig kun je muren best versterken\nmet twee systemen die goed samenwerken:\neen taaie extra laag \u00e8n koolstof strips.\n\n\"Quake Shield\" is de naam om te onthouen,\nwant als men toch de boel moet gaan verbouwen\ndan wil een mens natuurlijk wel iets hips.","Research title":"Combining existing independent seismic reinforcing methods for clay brick masonry: Knowledge development of the behaviour of reinforced masonry by using Finite Element Modelling ","url":"https:\/\/repository.tudelft.nl\/islandora\/object\/uuid%3Aec1fecb6-8e3f-4207-aea8-b9f4318d0330","Language":"NL","Abstract":"In the last decades induced earthquakes are taking place more frequently in Groningen. This is due to gas extraction form the soil. Buildings are damaged by the earthquakes and building collapse is possible in the near future. Houses in Groningen are commonly build up out of single leaf masonry cavity walls and are not designed for earthquake loads. Oosterhof Holman and SealteQ Group have designed a masonry reinforcing method that is called Quake-Shield. Quake-Shield is an unique reinforcing method and consists out of a combination of two existing independent seismic reinforcing measures. These two existing independent seismic reinforcing measures are: NSM FRP strips and an EB FRP layer. Carbon strips are placed in vertical grooves in the masonry which are filled with a ductile adhesive to bond the strips to the masonry (NSM FRP strips). A polymer or cementitious base layer with an embedded polymer or carbon mesh is attached to one side of the masonry on the outer surface (EB FRP layer). Both reinforcing measures increase stiffness, strength and ductility of the masonry. These three factors result in an increase in earthquake energy absorption and dissipation of the masonry. Which is important when reinforcing houses and buildings to prevent collapse due to earthquake loads. In this project a FEM model is made based on a three point bend test (out-of-plane bending) performed on Quake-Shield reinforced masonry samples. The FEM model is used to develop knowledge about the effect of combining two existing independent seismic reinforcing measures as used in the Quake-Shield masonry reinforcing method. The FEM model is a 3D model with a simplified micro-model approach for the masonry. The bricks are solid elements, the reinforcing materials are shell elements and the mortar and the ductile adhesive are interface elements. The bond-slip behaviour of the ductile adhesive has a significant contribution in the behaviour of Quake-Shield reinforced masonry. The mechanical properties of the ductile adhesive determines mainly the pre and post peak behaviour of the reinforced masonry. Providing gradually decline in load bearing capacity after the peak load. The EB FRP layer has a significant contribution to the reinforced masonry in the displacement range from the initiation of the first crack in the masonry till the onset of yielding of the EB FRP layer. In this range the EB FRP layer is the dominant reinforcing measure. After yielding of the EB FRP layer the NSM CFRP strip becomes the most dominant of the two. The EB FRP layer also provides cohesion between the individual bricks, keeping the masonry wall together after severe cracking has taken place. The FEM model is also used for a configuration analysis to research different geometrical and material variations of the Quake-Shield masonry reinforcing method. The configuration analysis gives more insight in the behaviour of reinforced masonry. For the configuration analysis two independent seismic reinforcing measures, NSM FRP strips and EB FRP layer, are applied separately to the FEM model. This is done to investigate its individual effect on the behaviour of reinforced masonry. Strip spacing has a significant effect on the load bearing capacity. If an epoxy is used as adhesive, which is much stronger and stiffer than the adhesive used by Quake-Shield, an increase in load bearing capacity is achieved but also sudden failure after the peak load is observed. This is an undesirable failure mode and reduces the total energy that the reinforced masonry can absorb.

Although various experimental studies have confirmed the potential drag reduction of dimpled surfaces in a turbulent boundary layer (BL), the working mechanism behind the effect remains largely unresolved. An experimental investigation is performed with the objective to strengthen the understanding of this novel aerodynamic surface and its interaction with the turbulent BL. Direct force measurements are combined with Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Particle Image Surface Flow Visualization (PISFV). The direct force measurements reveal that the drag reduction is highly sensitive on flow conditions, a finding with significant implications for further research as well as for potential applications. Furthermore, the PIV and PISFV measurements reveal a spanwise oscillation at the surface and at 0.2\u03b4 due to the interaction of individual dimple flow topologies, which are of the converger-diffuser type. The measurement of this oscillation is the first of its kind and provides strong evidence of a state-of-the-art drag reduction theory: the interaction between dimples causes alternating spanwise excitations of the near-wall flow which interacts with the turbulent coherent structures and therefore leads to a reduction of the turbulent drag. This theory is in contrast to what has often been proposed in literature. Dimples potentially have significant advantages over other means of passive flow control for drag reduction: they are very shallow and therefore do not require complicated cleaning or maintenance procedures, also they are not prone to wear such as riblets. Furthermore, they can easily be (retro)fitted on skin panels. This research provides fundamental data that contributes to the understanding of the flow mechanics of these dimpled surfaces in turbulent BLs.","Poem":{"Petrarchan sonnet":"\n\nThough drag reduction is a boon to us all,\nThe mechanism behind it remains unknown;\nWe seek to understand its interaction,\nWith turbulence and how it's grown.\n\nForces measured, PIV and PISFV too,\nReveal an oscillation at the surface spanwise true;\nInteraction of dimples causes excitation, \nWhich reduces turbulent drag with elation. \n\nBenefits abound with dimpled surfaces so shallow, \nMaintenance or cleaning not required at all; \nRiblets prone to wear are avoided with ease, \nAnd fitting on skin panels is a breeze. \n\nThis research brings data to light unseen, \nWhich will help us understand this novel machine; \nReduction in drag brings great potential savings, \nFor the economy and environment's balance."},"Jaccard distance":[0.9418604651],"Word intersect":[["benefits","dimpled","skin","piv","pisfv"]]},"26":{"Sonnet title":"Kluister","Sonnet text":"Twee satellieten vliegen in formatie\ntwee stipjes in het eindeloze zwart\nIn beiden klopt een elektronisch hart\ndat leeft van zonnekracht en informatie\n\nNet als twee zwemsters in't olympisch bad\nproberen zij perfect synchroon te blijven\nniet te tuimelen of af te drijven\nmaar goed te weten waar en hoe en wat.\n\nTwee zwemsters in het stille zwart, een tweeling,\ndie fluistert in elkaars geheime taal\ngiechelende smiespelende zusjes:\n\nIn formatie informatiedeling.\nEn spoort \u00e9\u00e9n van die twee niet helemaal\ndan corrigeert zij met geblazen kusjes.","Research title":"Design, Implementation and Verification of the Attitude Determination and Control Algorithms for the DelFFi Satellites","url":"https:\/\/repository.tudelft.nl\/islandora\/object\/uuid%3A4a5cacb7-b4dd-4665-b697-c53427b3bed6","Language":"NL","Abstract":"NaN","Poem":"NaN","Jaccard distance":"NaN","Word intersect":"NaN"},"27":{"Sonnet title":"Emoties","Sonnet text":"Emoties, dat zijn hele rare zaken,\nvoor een TU haast onbegaan gebied\nomdat een ingenieur zich liever niet\nvoor halve zachte dromer uit laat maken.\n\nMaar als je grootse dingen wilt bereiken\n(om aardolie bijvoorbeeld uit te bannen)\ndan zul je voor de uitvoer van die plannen\nnaar menselijke emoties moeten kijken.\n\nJe komt graag bij de mensen in de gunst...\nJe wilt de mensen heel graag engageren...\nEen krachtig middel daarvoor, dat is kunst.\n\nHet is alleen heel moeilijk te hanteren:\nEen groot effect, maar niet te controleren.\nDaarin lijkt kunst best veel op kernfuseren.","Research title":"Emotions matter for public engagement in the emerging biobased economy","url":"https:\/\/repository.tudelft.nl\/islandora\/object\/uuid%3A268baa72-59a8-4c40-9951-fc496803106b","Language":"NL","Abstract":"This thesis explores the role of emotions for triggering public engagement in the emerging bio-based economy.

Microelectrodes and neural interfaces are used to obtain the information contained in the neuronal networks activity, which can be used to control neural prosthetic devices. This field has advanced rapidly and the current research is focusing on multi-channel implementation of neural interface systems to monitor the activity of a large number of neurons simultaneously. Area and safety are two main constraints in the design of neural interface electronics. The chip area constraint is important to minimize the severity of the surgery and limit the displacement of the brain caused by the implanted device. The safety constraint is critical in avoiding the damage to the brain tissue. Both constraints create a limitation on the power consumption of the neural interface system. This limited power budget needs to be utilized carefully to implement a design with low noise and high data rate with as few computational resources as possible. An efficient design allows a large number of channels to be implemented within the allowed power budget. This thesis proposes behavioral models of the electrode and the neural interface front-end, a part which precondition the neural signals before they are further processed and stored. The functionality of the proposed models are verified and, together with a power estimation model, they are used to perform a system study to investigate the trade-offs between neural interface design parameters.","Poem":{"Petrarchan sonnet":"\n\nVerbonden met een web van neuronen,\nDe onderzoekers hebben veel gedaan;\nMicro-elektroden en interfaces,\nGebruikt om informatie te verzamelen. \n\nSnelle vooruitgang in dit veld is gemaakt,\nEn nu focust men op meer kanalen;\nHet gebied en de veiligheid zijn twee punten,\nDie de elektronica beperken. \n\nDe kracht die wordt gebruikt is beperkt,\nDus er moet slimme technologie komen; \nBehaviorale modellen worden voorgesteld, \nOm data-tarief en lawaai te bestendigen. \n\nEen systeemstudie laat toe om te kijken, \nNaar wat mogelijk is binnen de grenzen; \nAls deze technologie goed wordt toegepast, \nKunnen veel kanalen worden verwerkt."},"Jaccard distance":[0.9888888889],"Word intersect":[["data"]]},"29":{"Sonnet title":"Goud uit stro","Sonnet text":"Wie koolwaterstof tot brandstof maakt\nkrijgt vocht en het beruchte CO2\nDat laatste nu, daar zit de mensheid mee;\neen wereldwijde superrampspoed naakt.\n\nJe denkt: \"dat lossen we wel op\" maar nee\nregering op regering heeft verzaakt\ner wordt gepraat, maar geen beleid gemaakt\nen ijsbeerijs smelt langzaam weg in zee.\n\nMaar door slim te electrolyseren\nLukt het de reactie \u00f2m te keren\nmen vangt dan koolzuur uit de atmosfeer \u00e8n\n\nkan wind- en zonnestroom accumuleren.\n't Is niet genoeg, dat wil niemand beweren\nMaar't biedt een sprankje hoop voor natte beren.","Research title":"Electrochemical production of hydrocarbons from carbon dioxide and water","url":"https:\/\/repository.tudelft.nl\/islandora\/object\/uuid%3A7baee23c-bd31-4002-b5fc-2d627c766130","Language":"NL","Abstract":"Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 is one possibility to solve the electrical energy storage problem and decrease the amount of CO2. Copper is the only metal that has been reported to produce hydrocarbons in the electrochemical CO2 reduction at ambient pressure and temperature. External parameters (potential, temperature and electrolyte), copper catalyst morphology and purity and newly designed carbon-based electrodes were investigated. The highest Faraday efficiency towards hydrocarbons at 22\u00b0C was obtained at a fixed potential of -2.50 V vs. Ag\/AgCl reference electrode. The best electrolyte solution is 0.1 M KHCO3. Methane is the dominant product. FE towards ethylene maximizes at -2.25 V. Up to 40\u00b0C, the total Faraday efficiency towards hydrocarbons is not influenced by temperature, but ethylene amount increases with increasing temperature. Above 40\u00b0C hardly any hydrocarbons are formed. Altering the surface structure of the copper catalyst by electrodeposition give different results for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. The rougher the surface, the less methane and the more ethylene was formed. The macroscopic smooth surfaces are related to the (001) orientation and a rough macroscopic surface is related to the (111) orientation.

Extremely variable flows and fast morphological changes are the principal characteristics of this system, which presents exceptional challenges for river engineering. Distributary rivers from the major rivers in Bangladesh are a key element in providing fresh water to the South-West and Central regions of the country. With the arrival of the dry season and the drop of water levels in the rivers, some of the distributaries become disconnected during several months from their parent rivers because of aggradation at the offtake during the monsoon season. Acquisition of all the field data required for a detailed morphodynamic study of those offtakes is very often not possible, specially for preliminary designs or during the initial stages of a project. For the rivers of Bangladesh, bed topography data are even outdated in a matter of months because of the extremely dynamic nature of those rivers. In order to overcome this lack of data, the approach of this MSc thesis is to use a physics-based morphodynamic numerical model based only on the most significant characteristics of the offtake system to be analysed. If this model correctly reproduces the most important characteristics and evolution of the river and offtake system, it is then possible to use it for an initial assessment of remedial measures to prevent offtake closure. An analysis of the offtake systems is made before setting up the numerical model. The focus of this analysis is on the relevant physical processes for the evolution of offtakes. Furthermore, the causes of offtake closure occurring at the main distributaries of Bangladesh are identified and possible remedial measures are proposed to prevent them. The setup of the model is based on the findings from these previous analyses. The choice is for a 2D depth average numerical model using the software package Delft3D. A schematised geometry roughly based on the Ganges and Gorai rivers and offtake is used, with a total length of 100 km for the parent river and 20 km for the distributary channel. The simulation is initialised with a flat bed and a constant slope, which then develops into a realistic bed topography shaped by the morphological module of the numerical model. Because this model cannot be properly calibrated, as data available are not sufficient, the order of magnitude of model results is compared with observations of the river system. With this comparison, it is found that the model is able to reproduce the behaviour of the river system with enough accuracy to obtain the correct orders of magnitude for the evolution of the offtake system and the effects of interventions. The offtake behaviour simulated by the model is then analysed and used as reference scenario for the assessment of different engineering measures. The results of this assessment show that dredging the upstream part of the distributary river during the recession period of the monsoon can prevent the discontinuation of flow in the distributary river for the entire dry season, and improves the flow conditions for the following year. However, this measure needs to be applied regularly and does not stabilise the offtake in the long term. Other measures tested in the model are major dredging at the parent river to improve its alignment; construction of submerged erodible weirs; a flow divider and the use of longitudinal training walls to reduce the width of the parent river. However, these measures seem not to be effective in maintaining flow in the distributary river when implemented in the numerical model. In conclusion, the methodology developed in this thesis is able to overcome the lack of data availability and simulate realistic scenarios of the complex process of offtake closures. With this tool, it is possible to perform fast and inexpensive modelling of the behaviour of offtake systems and assessment of engineering measures to prevent offtake closure that otherwise would require much more resources.","Poem":{"Petrarchan sonnet":"\n\nFrom Bangladesh's riverine grandeur, so vast and strong,\nTwo of the world's largest rivers flow along;\nThe Ganges and Brahmaputra, their waters throng\nTo bring life to a land of complex song.\nA key element in providing fresh water there\nAre distributaries that branch off each pair;\nBut when dry season comes and water levels drop,\nThey're cut off from their parents' mighty stock.\nData acquisition is hard to come by;\nOutdated soon due to morphological change.\nA numerical model based on the facts known \nCan help assess remedial measures shown. \nDredging upstream helps maintain flows all year, \nAnd so can other interventions here. \nThis thesis proves a useful tool indeed: \nFor Bangladesh's rivers it is a great need."},"Jaccard distance":[0.9361702128],"Word intersect":[["flow","hard","ganges","dry","facts","rivers"]]},"32":{"Sonnet title":"Windgedreven Peristaltische Pomp","Sonnet text":"Kijk, 'peristaltiek' en 'windgedreven'\ndat roept natuurlijk associaties op:\nHet meest banale dringt ons in de kop.\nMaar lieve mensen wacht nou toch eens even! \n\nHet gaat hier niet om gas en ingewanden,\nmaar om een apparaat van groot belang\ndat simpel met een rotor en een slang\nschoon water pompt in barre, dorre landen. \n\nDat water is de bron van zoveel leven!\nEn de wind is enkel maar verbaasd\ndat hij de mensen nu zoiets mag geven. \n\nWaar hij doorgaans gehaat door vlaktes raast\nvoelt hij zich gewaardeerd nu en verheven\nals hij het leven in de aarde blaast.

Throughout history we can point to many failures of dams, and embankment dams in particular. Nowadays it is clear that the goal to construct stable dams has not been achieved, even with advanced technologies and construction techniques available. There are always unexpected factors which can produce unforeseen problems, and also most of the suitable sites are already utilized. This might increase the probability of failure in the future, therefore constructors will have to face more complicated geological conditions. The main reasons for failures are inconsistency between design (design hypothesis) and reality (unpredictability encountered on the site or during construction), natural processes like flash floods, rock and landslides, earthquakes and deliberate human actions. Research on failure case histories and lessons learned from them provide important answers and leads to improvement in dam safety approach. The concerns of dam safety are related to dam procedures that will avoid a dam break or diminish the probability of a dam break or any other abnormal event. Most of dam safety decisions are based on the predictions of the probability of dam failure and of resulting loss-of life. In this thesis the intention is to highlight the methodologies for dam safety decisions. Previously, risk and uncertainty methods have been applied for safety assessments of hydraulic structures but they were restricted to some extent. In this thesis an improvement of the methodology proposed by Hsu et al. (2011) is suggested in three aspects. The first is the development of multivariate flood frequency analyses in which the annual maximum peak discharges and the surface runoff are modeled as a bivariate distribution function. The second is the treatment of the initial reservoir level as a random variable, and the third is the overtopping assessment sample zone which is divided jointly by multivariate flood frequency, wind frequency and initial stage frequency, generating eight sub domains. Damage of property due to dam break discharge is certain, but loss of life depends on the flooded area and population. Therefore, analysis of dam breaching and the resulting floods are crucial for reduction of potential for loss of life and damage of property. Further in this thesis the breach itself and methodologies applied to quantify the peak discharge due to breaching are highlighted. Many computer models are capable of simulating dam-break hydrographs and routing these hydrographs downstream. However, dam break analysis models normally require certain geometric and temporal characteristics of the dam breach as inputs for the model. An alternative approach to estimating these parameters has been the use of case study data to develop empirical-regression relationships relating the peak discharge of the breach to the dam height and\/or reservoir-storage volume. An efficient model based on Kriging methodology is proposed to forecast peak discharge at certain height and volume of water respectively, behind the dam at failure. The time of occurrence and magnitude of floods is very difficult to predict while it is possible to predict fairly accurately the propagation of the flood wave along the river, once that a flood wave is generated at some upstream location in the river (in the case of this thesis due to dam break). The dam-break induced loads and their effects on buildings are of vital importance for assessing the vulnerability of buildings in flood-prone areas. A comprehensive methodology, for risk assessment of buildings subject to flooding, is nevertheless still missing. The intention of this thesis is to take a step forward by following previous research. A new and efficient variable that can take into account both the shape of the structure and flow conditions is proposed and new and practical formula for predicting the mean normalized force is suggested for different types of obstacles, which is missing in previous research. As a part of a dam safety assessment, an empirical breaching model is coupled with a numerical model in order to achieve a more accurate prediction. However, empirical models provide only peak discharge calculation, neglecting breach development in time. In this thesis a numerical model is constructed and a hydrograph is calculated based on dam breach development and failure time whereas breach parameters are calculated based on empirical model. Outcomes of this thesis can contribute to a growing tendency to assess the safety levels of existing dams based on risk and uncertainty analysis using mathematical and statistical models with multivariate flood frequency analysis. Previously designed dams should be checked with at least a bivariate analysis especially in the determination of spillway discharge coefficient and dam crest level. Breaching development is a complex process; therefore many assumptions have to be made in order to describe the process as close as possible, in the same time the structural uncertainties related to failure increase. In this thesis an efficient formula for better understanding and application of dam-break flow induced forces on structures of different cross sections is suggested with a new parameter that describes the shape of the obstacle which is named \u201cshape of influence\u201d. The importance of distinguishing the breach initiation time and breach development time is also highlighted in this thesis. So far, breach initiation time has not been considered as a distinct parameter in the majority of dam case studies, and it is not input in most of the numerical models. We could see that distinguishing between these two phases is still a difficult task because the guidance available for determination of the breach initiation time is very limited. In reality we can only predict breach development time.","Poem":{"Petrarchan sonnet":"\n\nOndanks de technologie\u00ebn en bouwtechnieken die vandaag de dag beschikbaar zijn, is het duidelijk dat het doel om stabiele dammen te bouwen nog steeds niet bereikt is.

They may also lead, however, to increased health risks due to the potential presence of waterborne pathogens. Exposure of humans to pathogens in urban water occurs through recreational activities, household uses, occupational exposure, consumption of crops irrigated with contaminated water, or accidentally. Research is needed on the health risks derived from urban water exposure to inform urban water authorities and help them to implement risk control and mitigation measures. In this thesis, the microbial health risks of several urban water features have been assessed using Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) tools. The studied water concepts are several features from an urban area (including a river, a lake, a sedimentation pond, a pond in the park, a wadi), a water plaza, reclaimed water used for crop irrigation, and drinking water produced from groundwater during the 2009 Q Fever outbreak. Pathogens studied include Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, adenovirus, norovirus, Legionella pneumophila, Coxiella burnetii and cyanobacteria. Faecal indicators and microbial source tracking tools were also used. The water features assessed showed high risks of gastrointestinal diseases (through Campylobacter or norovirus) but low risks of respiratory illness (legionellosis and Q fever). Higher concentration of Campylobacter, resulting in higher gastrointestinal risks, were found when human faecal contamination was present. Gastrointestinal disease risks were high even when faecal indicators were below the threshold for excellent bathing water quality according to the Bathing Water Directive. Higher risks are expected in the future due to warmer climate, and higher frequency and strength of rain events. Measures should be taken to reduce health risks (e.g., remove cross-connections in separate sewers, add extra barriers for the use of reclaimed water).","Poem":{"Petrarchan sonnet":"\n\nDe stad is vol met water, het geeft een schoonheid aan de buurt,\nHet biedt recreatie en plezier, maar ook veel risico's voor de gezondheid.\nExposure van mensen aan pathogenen kan via verschillende manieren voorkomen,\nDoor recreatieve activiteiten of door het eten van irrigatiewater.\n\nOm deze risico's te kunnen beoordelen is er onderzoek nodig,\nMet behulp van QMRA tools kunnen we hier meer over weten.\nDe resultaten tonen hoge risico's op maag-darmziektes, \nMaar lage risico's op longziektes zoals legionellose en Q-koorts. \n\nHogere concentraties Campylobacter leiden tot grotere risico's, \nVooral als er menselijke faeces in het water aanwezig is. \nMet de toename van warmere temperaturen zullen deze risico's verhogen, \nDaarom moet er actie worden ondernomen om dit tegen te gaan."},"Jaccard distance":[0.9574468085],"Word intersect":[["water","risico","onderzoek","stad"]]},"37":{"Sonnet title":"Verjongingskuur","Sonnet text":"Wij rijden op zeer open asfaltbeton.\nDie open structuur is voor auto's een zegen\nomdat, als dit land wordt geteisterd door regen,\nhet water snel wegvloeit \u2013 zelfs bij een moesson.\n\nE\u00e9n nadeel: zo'n zeer open weg brokkelt on-\nherroepelijk af.

The service life of PA wearing courses is limited because of the fact that it is vulnerable to raveling. The possibilities of applying preventive maintenance to PA wearing courses by means of spraying rejuvenation products on the pavement surfaces are being investigated with high interest in the Netherlands. A material which has the ability to penetrate into the bituminous binder and soften (rejuvenate) the hardened bituminous binder in the mortar is defined as a rejuvenator. Spraying rejuvenators on asphalt pavement surfaces before raveling starts (during the initiation of damage) might influence the characteristics of the hardened bituminous binder such that the service life of the PA surface layer is extended. Considering the fact that the rejuvenation effectiveness of potential rejuvenation products is not clear, they are called Surface Treatment Products (STP) in this research. The main objectives of this research are the investigation of the effect of surface treatments on the microstructure and performance of PA wearing courses and the assessment of their rejuvenation effectiveness. Three surface treatment products were applied on two field trials of 5 year old PA pavement surfaces, respectively on the A50 and A73 highways. Computed Tomography (CT) scanning with a conventional medical CT scanner was performed on the PA concrete cores that were obtained from the field trial sections to measure volumetric properties like air voids and mortar contents. It was found that the difference between the mean values of the air voids contents for the PA concrete cores from the reference (untreated) and treated sections is not statistically significant in most of the cases. CT scanning with a high-resolution industrial CT scanner was used to detect the surface treatment products. Two parameters, the mortar film thickness and the surface treatment product content, were used to quantify changes in the microstructure due to the surface treatments. The treated PA concrete samples showed an increased mortar film thickness, which indicates the presence of bituminous binder added by the surface treatment products. Visual inspections on PA concrete thin slices with an optical microscope were performed to investigate the microstructure of the treated PA concrete samples. Micro cracks were observed in the reference PA concrete samples but no micro crack was found in the treated PA concrete samples. To determine the rejuvenation effectiveness of surface treatment products, artificially aged PA 0\/16 concrete and mortar specimens were produced in the laboratory and the surface treatment products were applied to the specimens. The indirect tensile stiffness modulus and indirect tensile strength were measured on the PA concrete specimens. The results did not show a difference between untreated and treated specimens. For the mortar a special 3D finite element was developed before dynamic shear testing to study the influence of rejuvenation (diffusion inside the mortar) on mortar columns by simulating dynamic shear tests. From the results clear effects on the rheological behavior was shown. Based on the finite element results dynamic shear tests were used to measure the rheological and shear fatigue properties of mortar specimens. The results for the treated mortar specimens did not show a change in complex shear modulus and phase angle or shear fatigue properties compared to the reference mortar. It was concluded that no rejuvenation of the test samples did occur. Another finite element model was created for analyzing the stresses and strains as a result of traffic loads in a reference and treated PA pavement surface. The results showed that because of the added binder, the surface treatment does reduce the stresses, strains and dissipated energies in the mortar bridges at and close to the surface of the pavement, which will result in a higher fatigue life. In addition, the Rotating Surface Abrasion Test (RSAT), three-point being tests and nano-indentation tests were performed on the PA concrete cores taken from the reference and treated sections. The RSAT results for the treated PA concrete cores seem to indicate a lower stone loss than the reference PA concrete cores. The treated PA concrete beams showed higher mean stiffness values than the reference beams. From the nano-indentation tests, the presence of bituminous binders added by the surface treatment products to the mortar of the PA concrete was proven. Based on all the results, it was concluded that no rejuvenation took place. The product will have an effect. But that is because of added binder by the product. Furthermore, it was recommended that preventive maintenance interventions should be based on optical microscopy and nano-indentation tests on thin slices from small cores (?40 mm) rather than visual surveys of the pavement surface.","Poem":{"Petrarchan sonnet":"\n\nVerbonden aan de Nederlandse wegen,\nPorous Asphalt wordt veel gebruikt.\nDe levensduur is beperkt, raveling dreigt,\nDus onderzoek naar preventief onderhoud begint.\n\nRejuvenators die binder verzachten, \nKunnen mogelijk de schade beperken. \nToepassingen worden getest met interesse, \nMaar of ze werken blijft een grote vraag. \n\nCT-scans en microscopie tonen geen verandering, \nDe effectiviteit van STP's blijft onbekend. \nDynamic shear tests tonen geen verschil in kracht, \nEn nano-indentation test bevestigt dit met zacht. \n\nHoewel rejuvenatie niet plaatsvindt zoals gehoopt, \nZal toepassing van STP's wel voordelig zijn voor de kost. \nOptische microscopie en nano-indentation tests adviseren we sterk: \nOm schade te voorkomen is dat de beste werk!"},"Jaccard distance":[0.9818181818],"Word intersect":[["wegen","zoals"]]},"38":{"Sonnet title":"Noodhulp","Sonnet text":"De mens is bij rampen een nietig figuur.\nMaar, siddert de aarde dan stopt elk gekijf.\nGebroederlijk helpen we dan: 555,\nen hulptroepen, voedsel \u2013 geen raad is te duur.\n\nEchter, de medische apparatuur\ndie wij daarheen sturen redt hier menig lijf\nmaar blijft op een rampplek vaak buiten bedrijf.\nHet is niet gebouwd voor de gammele schuur\n\nof tent die daar dienst doet als noodhospitaal.\nEen betere overdracht is cruciaal\nen daarvoor is systems design je-van-het.\n\nOntwerp met dit doel: ieder apparaat moet\nin noodsituaties ook veilig en goed\nte bedienen zijn.

To provide healthcare assistance, international humanitarian organizations transfer a variety of medical equipment and staff to an affected area with the purpose of reinforcing or even replacing disrupted healthcare activities. The replacement system they transfer is usually of a high quality standard, and therefore not suitable to be transported, used, maintained and disposed in austere and low-resource settings. In comparison to providing food or shelter assistance, providing safe healthcare in such situations is particularly challenging due to the level of medical and technical expertise required. In this thesis, the unsustainability of the transfer process of medical equipment in humanitarian emergencies is addressed by describing and analysing how the transfer takes place. Furthermore, two field studies in Indonesia and Haiti are presented. The humanitarian sector is increasingly challenged by the need to become more efficient and competitive.

Users expect video search engines to be useful as an instrument that facilitates communication, education, entertainment and problem solving and, in relation to this, to satisfy diverse information needs. A user's information need is the lack that a user is attempting to overcome by engaging in information seeking behavior and can be seen as having two important dimensions: it comprises both a 'what' dimension reflecting the topic of the search and a 'why' dimension corresponding to the user intent, the immediate reason, purpose or goal behind the information need. Video search engines are relatively successful at returning search results that users find to be on topic. These results do not, however, completely satisfy the users' information needs unless they also fulfill the users' intents. The purpose of this thesis is to enable the intent-related focus shift in the design and realization of video search engines and to advance them in terms of user intent in order to satisfy users' information needs to their full extent. This advancement is challenging because it affects the entire pipeline of the video search engine: video indexing, query processing, and search results ranking. However, it also has the potential to substantially improve the overall utility of video search engines and increase the impact, significance and economic value of the online video content. We start to tackle this challenge by analyzing a real-world transaction log produced by a state-of-the-art video search engine with the objective to obtain a deeper understanding why queries submitted by users in their search sessions fail. Based on the results of this analysis, we build classifiers to automatically predict these reasons for query failure given a set of multimodal features derived from both the user interactions with the search engine as well as the search results produced by the engine. Our analysis of the transaction log reveals several distinct reasons for why user queries in video search fail. Among others, one of the reasons is the way user goals are expressed in the query, i.e., a single query can correspond to different underlying goals. In other words, intent is often not explicitly reflected in the query. This fact motivates us to tackle this challenge and to investigate the usefulness of incorporating user intent in video search engines. As a first step, we investigate the nature of the immediate reason, purpose or goal behind a user information need that constitutes intent. We carry out a social-Web mining approach combined with crowdsourcing and a manual coding process in order to derive a conceptual model (i.e., a typology constituting search intent categories) covering different reasons why users consult video search engines. This typology builds the basis for integrating user intent in video search engines. We then provide evidence that users differentiate videos in search engine results lists on the basis of these user intent categories. In addition to understanding which search intents exist in video search, it is equally important to understand which intents are associated with videos. This understanding is crucial, as it builds the foundation of matching the search intents expressed by users in search scenarios to the intents that are associated with videos stored in the video search engine's index. While in search scenarios intent can be characterized by the different reasons why users consult a video search engine, comparable user actions can be investigated for why videos were added to the search engine's index in the first place. For this reason, we investigate the user action of uploading videos to the Internet and apply a combination of social-Web mining and crowdsourcing to arrive at a conceptual model (i.e., a typology constituting uploader intent categories) that characterizes the various reasons why users upload videos to the Internet. We then build algorithms that automatically classify videos into these categories. Finally, we demonstrate that uploader intent categories correlate with search intent categories, which provides the opportunity for incorporating intent into the retrieval functions of video search engines. With search intent categories and uploader intent categories and their automatic prediction at hand, we face the challenging task of introducing user intent in search results rankings that produce video search results lists that optimally reflect user intent. We propose an intent-aware video search result optimization approach that exploits the structure of topically-relevant initial results lists produced by the search engine in response to user-submitted queries in order to predict which search intent\/s the user would most likely wish to satisfy. Based on this information, the approach optimizes the initial lists in a way that search results with the highest potential to satisfy the users' search intent\/s are positioned at the very top of the list without decreasing its topical focus. Finally, although this thesis contributes a substantial amount of research towards user intent-aware video search engines, we believe that additional challenges will emerge in the future that will go above and beyond the challenges addressed in this thesis. We identify and discuss these challenges and expect them to attract significant research efforts that will lead to productive outcomes in the field of user intent-aware video search engines in the following years.","Poem":{"Petrarchan sonnet":"\n\nEen user's informatiebehoefte is een gebrek dat hij wil overwinnen,\nMet twee dimensies: wat en waarom, zoals zijn intentie bepaalt.\nVideo zoekmachines geven resultaten die aansluiten bij de topic,\nMaar kunnen niet volledig voldoen aan de behoefte van de user.\n\nDeze thesis heeft als doel om video zoekmachines te verbeteren,\nZodat ze beter kunnen inspelen op intenties van users.\nHet onderzoek laat zien dat een query verschillende doelen kan hebben,\nWaardoor intentie vaak niet expliciet in de query wordt weergegeven. \n\nOm de search intents te begrijpen is het ook belangrijk om te weten, \nWaarom videos in de index zijn opgenomen door uploaders. \nSocial-Web mining en crowdsourcing leiden tot een typologie van intents. \nDaarnaast blijkt dat uploader intents overeenkomen met search intents. \n\nDeze thesis stelt een intent-aware video search result optimization voor, \nDie optimaal rekening houdt met users' search intents zonder topical focus te verliezen. \nDe uitdaging ligt nu in het verbeteren van video zoekmachines op basis van user intenties; \nEnkel dan kunnen we hun informatiebehoeften volledig bevredigen."},"Jaccard distance":[0.9821428571],"Word intersect":[["intenties","zoekmachines"]]},"40":{"Sonnet title":"Eigensensor","Sonnet text":"Van te veel warmte raak je overstuur.\nEen chip die te verhit raakt, expireert.\nSilicium, zo blijkt nu, assisteert\nbij microprocessorenlevensduur.\n\nJe meet de snelheid waarmee door heel puur\nsilicium de warmte diffundeert.\nDe thermische vertraging etaleert\nje dan heel nauwgezet de temperatuur.\n\nZo kan de chip dus z\u00e9lf de thermometer\nvan zijn systeem zijn, en het is dus beter\nals er silicium wordt ingebouwd.\n\nOok taal meet z\u00e9lf haar eigen krachtenveld:\nhet kan dat u voor deze woorden smelt\nmaar evengoed laat dit sonnet u koud.","Research title":"Integrated Temperature Sensors based on Heat Diffusion","url":"https:\/\/repository.tudelft.nl\/islandora\/object\/uuid%3Abd907442-60d2-4f76-a463-048db5d69d6a","Language":"NL","Abstract":"This thesis describes the theory, design and implementation of a new class of integrated temperature sensors, based on heat diffusion. In such sensors, temperature is sensed by measuring the time it takes for heat to diffuse through silicon. An on-chip thermal delay can be determined by geometry and the thermal diffusivity of silicon, and since the thermal diffusivity of crystalline silicon is strongly temperature-dependent, the thermal delay is also temperature dependent. The sensor structures that measure such delays are known as Electrothermal Filters (ETFs). The field of temperature sensing using ETFs is still relatively unexplored. This thesis expands upon recent proof-of-concept research by studying the performance of ETF-based temperature sensors in more detail. Its main goal is to analyze whether or not ETFs can be used as competitive temperature sensors in CMOS technology. The thermal delay in an ETF can be very well-defined, since the silicon used in IC fabrication is highly pure, and the lithographic inaccuracy with which planar structures can be made is constantly improving. ETFs thus scale along the trend of Moore\u2019s law, and they can become smaller, faster and more accurate in more advanced CMOS technologies. The main application of ETF-based temperature sensors is the thermal management of microprocessors: modern microprocessors require tens of small, fast and accurate temperature sensors to prevent overheating and to dynamically allocate processing power. Chapter 1 outlines this and other applications in some detail, and shows why existing temperature sensors are not well-suited for these applications. Chapter 2 presents the theoretical background to ETFs, starting with a discussion on the thermal diffusivity of silicon and silicon dioxide, analyzing their nominal values and their (different) temperature dependencies. It then discusses what type of ETFs to use to measure these most accurately. Furthermore, it outlines a family of performance metrics that enable a more formal study of ETFs characteristics. These are divided in two main categories: accuracy (e.g. error due to lithography, doping sensitivity) and resolution (how to optimize signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), advantages of scaling and using thermally isolated technologies such as silicon-on-insulator (SOI) processes). Chapter 3 presents various systems that can be built around ETFs. Using either silicon ETFs, oxide ETFs or a combination of both, several systems can be built, each with different functionality. The two systems described in most detail are the single silicon-ETF temperature-to-digital converter, and the silicon and oxide ETF-based self-referenced temperature-to-digital converter. The former uses an accurate time reference (such as a crystal oscillator) to convert an ETF\u2019s thermal delay to an absolute temperature measurement. The latter performs a ratiometric temperature measurement and does not require an external time reference. This chapter also defines all of the circuit building blocks required to implement these systems, and derives their specifications from ETF theory and first principles. It concludes by showing that phase-domain sigma-delta modulators (PD??Ms) are the most appropriate readout circuits for precision ETF readout. Chapter 4 discusses PD??Ms in more detail and presents their transistor-level implementation. PD??Ms are a class of time-to-digital converters that are well-suited to digitize the thermal delay contained in the small, noisy signal at the ETF\u2019s output. High precision and resolution are achieved by oversampling, noise shaping and the use of dynamic error correction techniques. Several methods of linearizing ETF-based temperature-to-digital converters are also presented. The chapter ends with measurements on a standalone PD??M, in order to show that its measurement error is sufficiently low to be able to characterize ETFs. Chapter 5 presents the measurement results for the ETFs studied in this thesis. There are results on ETF inaccuracy and resolution as a function of geometry and process technology, as well as results on sensitivity to doping fluctuations, mechanical stress, thermal interference and self-heating. The measured differences in ETF performance in bulk CMOS and SOI CMOS technology are also presented and analyzed. The lowest measured untrimmed inaccuracy for a single-ETF sensor in 0.18?m CMOS technology was \u00b10.2\u00baC (3?) from -55\u00baC to 125\u00baC. A self-referenced sensor, based on measuring the ratio of the thermal delay in silicon over that in oxide, shows a measured inaccuracy of \u00b10.4\u00baC (3?) from -70\u00baC to 200\u00baC after a one-point trim. Chapter 6 lists the main findings of this thesis and uses the measurement results to draw some conclusions on the competitiveness of ETFs. It shows that ETFs, due to their scalability, are attractive for thermal management of SoCs in deep submicron CMOS technologies. This thesis ends with some recommendations for further research.","Poem":{"Petrarchan sonnet":"\n\nDeze proefschrift beschrijft de theorie, het ontwerp en de implementatie van een nieuwe klasse ge\u00efntegreerde temperatuursensoren, gebaseerd op warmteverspreiding.

Unfortunately, the integration of such devices into society is to date still limited. This is in part due to the much less than optimal efficiency of conversion of sunlight to electricity, but also by the physical limitations of integrating photovoltaic devices into the built environment. In this thesis, efficiency enhancement of solar energy conversion by application of thin film luminescent spectral conversion materials is discussed on the one hand and on the other hand the development of thin film materials for luminescent solar concentration that lead to new means of building-integration of photovoltaic devices. Currently available reports on spectral shifting materials for efficiency enhancement of solar cells is mostly limited to fabricating luminescent powder materials that could possibly serve as spectral shifting materials and modelling the efficiency enhancement. The work that was discussed in this thesis has the common goal of developing experimental methods to make thin films by reactive magnetron sputtering that may be applied as efficiency-enhancing coatings for photovoltaic devices. While the fabrication process is still prone to various complications, magnetron sputtering has proved a viable technique for luminescent thin film deposition.","Poem":{"Petrarchan sonnet":"\n\nVerloren licht, verloren stroom, zo\u2019n schande voor de mensheid.\nEen bron van duurzame energie die ongebruikt blijft door onze domheid.\nDe technologie is er al, maar de toepassing komt niet voor de dag.\nHet rendement is te laag, en fysiek beperkt het gebruik in de stad.\n\nThin films met lichtgevende materialen kunnen hierbij helpen.\nDoor magnetron sputtering worden ze gemaakt met veel zorg en welpen.\nDe conversie van zonlicht naar elektriciteit wordt hierdoor geoptimaliseerd.\nMet deze technologie kan eindelijk het duurzame voordeel worden gelezen. \n\nGezamenlijk streven we naar een betere wereld voor morgen. \nDuurzame energie moet nu als prioriteit worden genomen. \nAlleen zo kunnen we voorkomen dat het licht voorgoed verdwijnt, \nEn dat we opnieuw kunnen genieten van alle voordelen die het brengt!"},"Jaccard distance":[0.9555555556],"Word intersect":[["betere","conversie","rendement","laag"]]},"42":{"Sonnet title":"Vermoeiingsfysica","Sonnet text":"Een boot moet, bij een reddingsoperatie,\nvaak pijlsnel naar de plek des onheils toe.\nEen zware, stalen romp is dus taboe;\nmen kiest een aluminium formatie.\n\nMaar snelheid leidt ook snel tot irritatie\nen net als mensen wordt metaal dan moe.\nDan scheurt de romp dus, en de vraag is: hoe?\nWat blijkt: er is een \u00e9\u00e9n-op-\u00e9\u00e9n relatie\n\nmet hoe de romp gelast is, want wat vaststaat:\neen scheur loopt langs of loodrecht op de lasnaad.\nJe kunt voorspellen hoe het zal gebeuren.\n\nMet hulp van de vermoeiingsfysica\ngaan fysici dus onvermoeibaar na\nhoe lang de speedboot nog kan blijven scheuren.","Research title":"Fatigue resistance of welded joints in aluminium high-speed craft: A total stress concept","url":"https:\/\/repository.tudelft.nl\/islandora\/object\/uuid%3A370b3d44-f4a6-403e-9629-d36174c3aca4","Language":"NL","Abstract":"Crew transfers, surveillance duties and {security, rescue, interception} operations at sea typically require high-speed craft. Aluminium is quite often selected as hull structure material because of its weight save potential in comparison to steel. The fatigue strength, however, may become a point of concern because of the decreased Young\u2019s modulus. Bottom slamming is identified as a dominant type of repeated loading, meaning fatigue is a governing limit state in aluminium high-speed craft design. Particular attention in that respect is paid to arc-welded joints connecting the hull structure components, {plates, shells}, since the weld geometry introduces notches; fatigue sensitive locations. Fatigue physics cover an extensive range of scales and modelling may require a multi-scale approach. Adopting a structural response parameter S available at FSS level using global information only, however, seems attractive since S controls plasticity \u2013 required to facilitate fatigue damage: crack initiation, growth, propagation and fracture \u2013 at macro (structural)- as well as meso and micro (material) scale, but pays off in fatigue resistance data scatter and life time estimate uncertainty. Including physics at smaller scale, local information, improves the accuracy. A continuous increase of the considered scale range of physics as observed in fatigue assessment concepts developed over time \u2013 proposed to be classified according to approach, criterion, parameter and process zone \u2013 is however typically associated to increased (computational) effort and concept complexity. At the same time, similarity; proper scaling, meaning equal parameter values should yield the same fatigue resistance, seems still incomplete since all concepts available involve multiple fatigue resistance curves rather than one. From {MCF, HCF} design perspective, a local continuum mechanics approach seems sufficient and a total stress concept is proposed to balance accuracy, effort and complexity, improving similarity at the same time to obtain one aluminium arc-welded joint fatigue resistance curve. The weld geometry introduces at least a notch at the weld toe and depending on penetration level another one at the weld root. Cracks may initiate at both fatigue sensitive locations, grow principally in {plate, shell} thickness direction and continue to propagate in general either along or perpendicular to the weld seam through {plate, shell} because of the structure orthotropic stiffness characteristics, suggesting a {plate, shell} thickness based (detectable repair) criterion to be an appropriate fatigue design parameter. The total through-thickness weld notch stress distribution along the expected crack path {??_n?^T,??_nr?^T }, including both the ocean\/sea waves induced cyclic remote mechanical loading- and welding process related quasi-constant thermal residual part, is assumed to be a key element. The predominant remote mechanical loading mode-I contribution {?_n,?_nr } has been examined to distinguish the involved stress components. A self-equilibrating weld geometry stress \u2013 consisting of a local V-shaped notch- and weld load carrying part \u2013 and equilibrium equivalent global structural field stress are identified; a refinement of a well-known definition. The semi-analytical formulations are related to the welded joint far field stress, calculated using a relatively coarse meshed {plate, shell} FE model as typically available for fatigue design purposes. Exploiting (non-)symmetry conditions, a generalised formulation demonstrating stress field similarity has been obtained and extends to the welding induced thermal residual stress distributions {??_n?^r,??_nr?^r }. Fatigue scaling requires both the (zone 1) peak value and (zone 2 notch affected and zone 3 far field dominated) gradient to be incorporated, meaning a damage criterion should take the complete distribution into account. The SIF K seems to meet this criterion, though, the intact geometry related notch stress distributions should be correlated to crack damaged equivalents; fatigue is assumed to be a crack growth (dominated) process. At the same time, hull structure arc-welded joints inevitably contain flaws or crack nuclei (defects) at the weld toe- and root notches, i.e. using the damage tolerant mode-I parameter K_I seems justified since fatigue associated to the {MCF, HCF} life time range at both locations will predominantly be a matter of micro- and macro-crack growth. The zone 3 related equilibrium equivalent stress contribution has been used to obtain a far field factor, distinguishing different type of cracks related to (non-) symmetry conditions for both (quasi) 2D- and 3D configurations. A notch factor incorporates the zone {1, 2} governing self-equilibrating stress. Remote mechanical weld toe- and weld root stress intensities show the zone {1, 2} notch affected- and zone 3 far field dominated parts define a micro- and macro-crack region, turning the stress field similarity into a stress intensity similarity. Each stress component dominates a certain crack length range: the notch stress the micro-crack region, the structural field stress the macro-crack region; the weld load carrying stress determines the transition (i.e. apex) location. The welding induced and displacement controlled mode-I residual stress intensity factor ?K_I?^r is acquired for both weld toe and weld root notches to complete the total weld notch stress intensity similarity factor formulation ?K_I?^T. Cyclic remote mechanical- and quasi-constant thermal residual loading turn ?K_I?^T into a crack growth driving force ??K_I?^T and defects may develop into cracks. The crack growth rate (da\/dn) of micro-cracks emanating at notches show elastoplastic wake field affected anomalies, i.e. monotonically increasing or non-monotonic behaviour beyond the material threshold. Modifying Paris\u2019 equation, a two-stage micro- and macro-crack growth law similarity is proposed to include both the weld notch- and far field characteristic contributions, elastoplasticity as well as remote mechanical- and thermal residual mean stress effects. Small\/short crack growth data obtained using standard specimens including {SEN, DEN, CEN} in crack configuration \u2013 representing weld root notch geometries at the same time \u2013 available in literature has been reinvestigated for the alternating material zones in (aluminium) arc-welded joints: WM and HAZ zone containing respectively the weld root- and weld toe notch fatigue damage location, as well as BM for comparison. Fatigue testing series have been developed to identify crack growth behaviour at weld toe notches in aluminium arc-welded joints, adopting a typical fillet weld DS T-joint geometry. Using DIC, the required far field- and notch region parameters are obtained. Spatial displacement fields are estimated on a general kinematic basis using commercial DIC software (Istra4D, Dantec Dynamics). A posteriori, as a mechanical filtering process, the displacement fields are decomposed onto a selected kinematic basis, i.e. an Airy stress function. The displacement amplitudes, least squares solutions, present in a one-to-one correspondence the crack growth governing parameters: linear far field stress distribution, SIF and crack tip location. A sequence of images provides the temporal solution; weld toe crack growth data series showing both far field characteristics and notch affected (non-monotonic) anomalies. Crack growth model integration yields a (MCF) single slope resistance relation, a joint S_T-N curve correlating arc-welded joint life time N and the total stress parameter S_T; a line (equivalent point) criterion to estimate hull structure longevity ensuring {SSS, LSS, FSS} welded joint fatigue resistance similarity. A dual slope (i.e. random fatigue limit) formulation has been adopted to incorporate HCF taking the transition in fatigue damage mechanism (i.e. growth dominant turns into initiation controlled for decreasing load level), a slope change, into account. Regression analysis (i.e. a likelihood approach) is adopted to estimate model parameters, managing both complete- and right-censored data; failures and run-outs. Artificial fatigue test data of DS T-joints is investigated to determine the S_T parameter quality. The fatigue life uncertainty is about a factor 2 (T_S?1:1.2). As-welded SSS (T-T) CA data available in literature has been used to establish a family of (damage tolerant engineering) joint S_T-N fatigue resistance design curves to be able to estimate the fatigue life time N of welded joints (production quality is average) knowing the joint geometry and far field structural response. The MCF life time uncertainty bandwidth increases up to a factor 6, i.e. (T_S?1:1.6). In the hull structure (HCF) design region uncertainty is significant, predominantly because of lacking complete data. Full scale structure representative {T-T literature, T-C} CA LSS data has been examined to verify a SSS data scatter band fit. Since CA {SSS, LSS} fatigue resistance is principally used to estimate a VA FSS value adopting the Palmgren-Miner hypothesis, VA SSS data available in literature is examined and a scatter band fit is observed. The involved equivalent total stress parameter S_(T,eq) is obtained adopting an extended rain flow counting algorithm to capture the damage cube. Last but not least, hourly fatigue damage estimates D_h are obtained for some frame-stiffener connections in the slamming zone of an aluminium high-speed craft, using the FSS response as measured for several trials at the North Sea. The wave (loading) statistics induced D_h uncertainty is about a factor 2.5 comparing the measurement- and simulation structural response based values; quite close to the MCF fatigue design resistance value of 3 (R99Cxx \u2013 R50Cxx). The TS concept is implemented in a high-speed craft fatigue design tool, available to all research partners. Using the welded joints geometry- and loading induced far field structural response information, the fatigue damage estimate D(S_T ) of all notch locations is calculated and the governing one identified to obtain life time N.","Poem":{"Petrarchan sonnet":"\n\nZoals aluminium gekozen wordt voor zijn licht gewicht,\nKomt er ook een kwestie met de jonge modulus;\nWant als er steeds geladen wordt door het gewicht,\nIs er meer kans op vermoeiing en dat is wat ons doet twijfelen.\n\nDe verbinding van de platen of schalen met lassen,\nMaakt de locaties waar het meest vermoeid raakt;\nHet vereist veel aandacht en een multi-scale benadering,\nOm ervoor te zorgen dat het niet teveel schade maakt.\n\nE\u00e9n curve die alle vermoeiingsweerstand laat zien,\nLijkt nog niet te bestaan in deze tijd; \nMaar door een lokale continuummechanica toe te passen, \nKunnen we proberen om dit probleem op te lossen. \n\nWe moeten de volledige stressverdeling begrijpen, \nInclusief thermische spanning en mechanische belasting; \nEn door middel van micro- en macro-krachten samengesteld, \nKunnen we uiteindelijk \u00e9\u00e9n curve cre\u00ebren.  \n\nAls we dan de vermoeiingsgrenswaarde berekenen, \nKunnen we levensduur voorspellen met meer precisie; \nDoor helemaal tot in detail naar alles te kijken, \nZullen we veiligheid bieden aan onze high-speed craft."},"Jaccard distance":[0.9672131148],"Word intersect":[["\u00e9\u00e9n","toe","aluminium","voorspellen"]]},"43":{"Sonnet title":"Hoe groeit een stad?","Sonnet text":"Hoe groeit een stad?

Also in creating and communicating music, multiple modalities are at play. Next to this, it allows for various ways of interpretation: the same musical piece can be performed in different valid ways, and audiences can in their turn have different reception and interpretation reactions towards music. Music is experienced in many different everyday contexts, which are not confined to direct performance and consumption of musical content alone: instead, music frequently is used to contextualize non-musical settings, ranging from audiovisual productions to special situations and events in social communities. Finally, music is a topic under study in many different research fields, ranging from the humanities and social sciences to natural sciences, and\u2014with the advent of the digital age\u2014in engineering as well. In this thesis, we argue that the full potential of digital music data can only be unlocked when considering the multifaceted aspects as mentioned above. Adopting this view, we provide multiple novel studies and methods for problems in the Music Information Retrieval field: the dedicated research field established to deal with the creation of analysis, indexing and access mechanisms to digital music data. A major part of the thesis is formed by novel methods to perform data-driven analyses of multiple recorded music performances. Proposing a top-down approaches investigating similarities and dissimilarities across a corpus of multiple performances of the same piece, we discuss how this information can be used to reveal varying amounts of artistic freedom over the timeline of a musical piece, initially focusing on the analysis of alignment patterns in piano performance. After this, we move to the underexplored field of comparative analysis of orchestral recordings, proposing how differences between orchestral renditions can further be visualized, explained and related to one another by adopting techniques borrowed from visual human face recognition techniques. The other major part of the thesis considers the challenge of auto-suggesting suitable soundtracks for user-generated video. Building on thoughts in Musicology, Media Studies and Music Psychology, we propose a novel prototypical system which explicitly solicits the intended narrative for the video, and employs information from collaborative web resources to establish connotative connections to musical descriptors, followed by audiovisual reranking. To assess what features can relevantly be employed in search engine querying scenarios, we also further investigate what elements in free-form narrative descriptions invoked by production music are stable, revealing connections to linguistic event structure. Further contributions of the thesis consist of extensive positioning of the newly proposed directions in relation to existing work, and known practical end-user stakeholder demands. As we will show, the paradigms and technical work proposed in this thesis managed to push significant steps forward in employing multimodality, allowing for various ways of interpretation and opening doors to viable and realistic multidisciplinary approaches which are not solely driven by a technology push. Furthermore, ways to create concrete impact at the consumer experience side were paved, which can be more deeply acted upon in the near future.","Poem":{"Petrarchan sonnet":"\n\nMuziek is een veelzijdig fenomeen: het adresseert niet alleen ons auditieve kanaal, maar ook andere zintuigen.

The correct functioning of trams, metros and trains is required to regularly transport hundreds of millions of passengers and tons of goods. A key aspect to guarantee the massive passenger and freight transport is to prevent or, at least, slow down railway deterioration. The main goal of this dissertation is to have a better understanding of track vibrations and interactions between components. In turn, such deeper understanding will enable us to slow down the deterioration through new, optimized track designs and maintenance measures, thus extending the service life of railway tracks and, consequently, lower their life-cycle costs. Therefore, we focus on measuring and modeling the vertical dynamics of railway tracks. The first part of the dissertation focuses on the in-depth analysis of extensive field hammer test measurements. Hammer tests are simple and inexpensive, yet they provide valuable information about the characteristic frequencies of tracks. To assess the potential of hammer tests to be employed for track deterioration investigation, we designed and conducted a feasibility study on insulated rail joints (IRJs) in the field. First, a reference dynamic response is defined and then it is compared to the response of three different damaged IRJs. Three characteristic frequency bands related to the damaged IRJs are derived independently of the type of damage. In view of these promising results, a Frequency Response Function (FRF)-based statistical method is proposed to identify characteristic frequencies of railway track defects. The method compares a damaged track state to a healthy state, which, in this case, is defined following the concepts of control charts employed in process monitoring. The FRF-based statistical method is tested at squats of different severity in two tracks types. For both squats and damaged IRJs, the identified characteristic frequencies agree with those found with an extensively validated vehicle-borne detection system (i.e. Axle Box Acceleration (ABA) system). This means we are indeed able to identify characteristic frequencies of defects using hammer tests. In the second part of the dissertation, a three-dimensional finite element (3D FE) model of tracks with monoblock sleepers is developed to study in-detail track vertical dynamics. This sleeper type is used worldwide, but its dynamic behavior is often not accurately considered in track models. To study the track dynamics, hammer tests are numerically reproduced applying an Implicit\u2013Explicit FE procedure. First, the equilibrium state of the track is calculated and then the response of the track to hammer excitation is simulated in the time domain. Next, our 3D FE model and field measurements are combined by fitting simulations to measurements, so that (1) the model is validated and the accuracy to reproduce measurements is determined, (2) the in-service track parameters are derived, and (3) insight is gained into the contribution of components to track dynamics and the effect of simplifications in modeling. After validating our 3D FE model with measurements and performing a comprehensive analysis, we find that the frequency response between 300 and 3000 Hz is defined by seven characteristic features and vibration modes. This is an important result for understanding track dynamics, given that the tracks with biblock sleepers only have four such features. The bending modes of monoblock sleeper and the stronger coupling between the two rails cause two of the additional features. The third additional feature occurs in the frequency range dominated by the rail-railpad-sleeper interaction. With the 3D FE model as basis, the influence of the representation of this interaction into the numerically calculated vertical dynamics is investigated. For this purpose, four fastening representations are developed: (1) commonly used spring-damper pair, (2) area covering spring-damper pairs, (3) solid railpad connected to the rail, and (4) solid railpad in frictional contact with the rail and fixed to the support by preloaded springs, which represent the clamps. Their comparison shows that the overall numerical reproduction of the measurements improves the more realistic is the representation of the fastening. If the accuracy of the fastening models is quantified, the model with solid railpads and clamps reproduce the seven characteristics at a maximum frequency difference of 6%, whereas for the conventional model, the difference can be as high as 27%. The lateral and longitudinal dimensions of the railpad, and the lateral and longitudinal constraints between the rail and support applied by the fastening, are both relevant aspects to consider when modeling fastenings. By examining field measurements and numerical models, useful information is gained for track design and for the development of maintenance measures. Regarding measurements, if field hammer tests are analyzed by employing the FRF-based statistical method, characteristic frequencies of track defects can be identified and can become valuable input data for the development of vehicle-born detection systems, such as ABA systems. Concerning the 3D FE model, a deep insight into the vertical dynamics of tracks with monoblock sleepers is obtained and the comprehensive study of fastening representation has indicated the need to model this track component more realistically, so that the track dynamics at high frequencies can be correctly reproduced. This finding should be considered in vehicle-track models to improve the reproduction of vehicle-track high frequency dynamics. A more realistic fastening modeling is especially required to represent tracks with rail defects since the defect's development may be related to the condition of the fastening. Thus, the advanced fastening models presented in this research are expected to significantly contribute to the investigation of fastening degradation and track defects. In addition, the evolution of in-service track parameters (i.e. stiffness and damping of railpad and ballast) identified during the fitting process can be monitored and it may become valuable input data for the planning of maintenance. Overall, our combination of measurements and numerical models contributes to the understanding of track dynamics. Furthermore, we have provided models and tools that can be used for the investigation and monitoring of track deterioration.","Poem":{"Petrarchan sonnet":"\n\nVergaat de spoorweg, dan voelen wij het meteen:\nHonderden miljoenen reizigers en goederen vervoeren is een taak die steeds weer gebeurt.\nEen sleutel om dit te garanderen is om de schade tegen te gaan of tenminste te vertragen.\nDit onderzoek heeft als doel om trillingspatronen beter te begrijpen,\nZodat nieuwe ontwerpen en maatregelen kunnen worden ingezet om de levensduur van sporen te verlengen.\nDe eerste fase richt zich op uitgebreide veldmetingen met behulp van hamertests.\nOm de potentie hiervan in kaart te brengen, wordt een studie gedaan naar ge\u00efsoleerde railscharnieren.\nDe resultaten laten zien dat frequenties van defecte rails kunnen worden ge\u00efdentificeerd met behulp van hamertests. \nDaarom wordt er een statistische methode voorgesteld waarbij frequentieresponsiefuncties worden vergeleken tussen een gezond en beschadigd spoor. \nMet behulp van finite elementmodellen kunnen trillingspatronen nauwkeuriger wordn bestudeerd. \nDeze modellen biednen inzicht in de bijdrage van componenten aan dynamische trilling, wat helpt bij het ontwikkeln van onderhoudsmaatregelen voor langere levensduur van sporen."},"Jaccard distance":[0.9666666667],"Word intersect":[["spoor","voelen","wij","weer"]]},"46":{"Sonnet title":"Wij leven van de wind","Sonnet text":"Wij leven van de wind, leert een gezang\ndat deel is van het liedboek voor de kerken.\nDat lied laat zich niet tot geloof beperken,\nwant ook bij energie is wind in zwang.\n\nJe ziet in een windmolenwiekengang\nmeestal drie bladen.

Onshore wind energy, however, faces social resistance and a lack of available locations. Offshore wind energy, on the other hand, offers vast amounts of suitable locations and less social resistance, but is still rather expensive compared to other energy sources. In order to reduce the costs of offshore wind energy, new wind turbine opportunities are considered. One such opportunity can be found in two-bladed wind turbines, which offer several advantages over its conventional three-bladed counterpart. Whereas control for three-bladed wind turbines has been extensively explored and discussed in literature, this is not the case for two-bladed wind turbines. Therefore, in this thesis, various structured controller approaches, with the aim to reduce the turbine loads, of two-bladed wind turbines are proposed, designed, and evaluated.","Poem":{"Petrarchan sonnet":"\n\nDe energie van de wind is door de jaren heen steeds meer gegroeid,\nHet wordt als duurzame bron gezien en is kosteneffici\u00ebnt.\nOnshore windmolens kunnen wel tegenstand ondervinden,\nEn er zijn maar weinig locaties die geschikt zijn voor hun vinden.\n\nOffshore biedt veel meer ruimte, maar ook hier liggen kosten hoog,\nDaarom worden nieuwe technieken bedacht om zo goedkoop mogelijk te gaan.\nTwee-bladen windmolens bieden vele voordelen aan, \nMaar er is nog weinig bekend over hun controleplan. \n\nDaarom wordt in dit proefschrift een onderzoek gestart, \nOm met verschillende structuren de belasting van de turbine te verkleinen meteen. \nZo kan offshore windenergie betaalbaar blijven staan, \nEn eindelijk kan er schoonheid uit duurzaamheid ontstaan."},"Jaccard distance":[0.9473684211],"Word intersect":[["energie","bladen","onderzoek","twee","wind"]]}}
