Oh well…

Drilling wells is an expensive process.
Thus whenever we can be more clever
we are saving money, time and effort.
This incites economy and progress.

Optimizing well trajectory
requires input from geologists
drill engineers and geophysicists
their expertise and their directory.

Determining the perfect minimum
amount of wells computers pretty well
can guess, as does this master student tell.

But still, trajectories their optimum
requires judgment – engineers to dwell
an index finger in their mouth: ‘Oh well…’

*My love is like a well, so deep and true
I'd dig it with my hands if I only knew
The way to make my way down to the bottom
To where your cool, clear water awaits me

I'd drink of you until I was sated
And then I'd climb back up and out
Into the sunlight, where I'd find
You waiting for me, smiling and patient

Your love is a well I could drink from forever
And never grow tired or thirsty
I know that I could be happy
Just digging in your depths with my bare hands
§When I was younger, I thought that well digging
would be a fun and easy job.
But now that I am older, I realize that it's not
as easy as it looks.

It takes a lot of hard work and dedication
to dig a well that's deep and true.
And though the pay is not that great,
the satisfaction of a job well done
is worth more than money could ever buy.

So if you're thinking of becoming a well digger,
be prepared to work long and hard.
But in the end, it will be worth it,
for there's nothing quite like the feeling
of bringing water to those who need it.
